Impacts of computer of society

The relationship between computing technologies and society is very complex
For the past 70 years computing tech. has changed society faster and more dramatically than any other development.
Many developments are positive but many have negative effects e.g. DNA matching combined with digitisation of public records has transformed our ability to research family history but can be used to find missing people or criminal suspects. This raises many ethical questions

Computer science is changing everything : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvyTEx1wyOY


--- Slide 24 ---

Impacts of Computers on society

It’s impossible to think of one facet of modern lives that computers haven’t affected – normally, but not always, for the better 
It is very difficult to avoid using the Internet. More and more the internet is built into our everyday experiences. The internet is expected to play an even greater part in our day to day lives


--- Slide 25 ---

Medicine and Healthcare

Computing technology has greatly improved medicine and healthcare.
Much of modern medicine still depends on people, which carries a risk of human error. Often a diagnosis is based on the interpretation of information by a single person – and people make mistakes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V680nMGpeEM&t=8s


--- Slide 26 ---

Medicine and Healthcare

Computing is transforming medicine by assisting medical professionals to make a diagnosis.


--- Slide 27 ---

Medicine and Healthcare – Image recognition and classification algorithms

Image recognition and classification algorithms are already being used to identify cancerous tumours in medical imaging.
This was done up to recently solely by people, but now with assistance from computers the chances of errors occurring can be greatly reduced.


--- Slide 28 ---

Medicine and Healthcare – Image recognition and classification algorithms

The computer pre-process the images and identify potentially cancerous tumours. A human expert can then pay extra attention to these images
The computer can also post-process images that were already checked by an expert to ensure nothing was missed.


--- Slide 29 ---

Medicine and Healthcare – Clinical Decision Support Systems

In Ireland, the GP, plays a central role in the healthcare system and is normally the 1st person seek medical advice
Some GPs are already using computers to help them do their work better. One specific area that’s in a rapid state of change is clinical decision systems


--- Slide 30 ---

Medicine and Healthcare – Clinical Decision Support Systems

A clinical decision support system provides doctors with assistance in making medical decisions.
The system can be knowledge based. The system uses information from medical literature and expert knowledge 
The system can be based on artificial intelligence.


--- Slide 31 ---

Medicine and Healthcare – Clinical Decision Support Systems – An example

Patient presents with a fever, headache and a rash on the stomach
Traditionally the doctor must rely on their experience and knowledge (both of which may be biased and based on limited number of cases) to guide their diagnosis
A Clinical Support System instantly draws upon symptoms and diagnosis from thousands of cases and factor them into the diagnosis


--- Slide 32 ---

Medicine and Healthcare – Clinical Decision Support Systems – An example

Other not readily accessible information can be used with these systems e.g The system may prompt the doctor to ask if the patient travelled abroad recently as these 3 symptoms are common to a rare disease in some distant country
 The doctor may not have come across this disease before. Without the clinical support system, the doctor may not have considered this possibility


--- Slide 33 ---

Medicine and Healthcare – Genomics

A field of molecular biology that focuses on genomes, a complete set of an organisms DNA
Several thousand genetic diseases affect humans and are 1 of the main causes of infant deaths. (Downs Syndrome, Fragile X syndrome..) Identifying which genetic disease is affecting a critically ill child is very difficult and often time is of the essence


--- Slide 34 ---

Medicine and Healthcare – Genomics - Example

The Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine in the US reported a baby suffering from liver failure for an unknown reason. The hospital used 25 hours of supercomputer time to analyse 120 Billion DNA sequences, narrowing down the cause of the illnss to two possibilities. This allowed the doctors to save the baby’s life. Without advanced computing technology the baby would have died.


--- Slide 35 ---

Medicine and Healthcare – Genomics – Screening for genetic markers

Scientists have identified genetic markers that can indicate a predisposition to certain diseases, including several types of cancer.
Screening for some inherited and other genetic diseases is now common


--- Slide 36 ---

Medicine and Healthcare – Genomics – Screening for genetic markers

Cystic fibrosis, and Huntingdon’s disease are caused by genetic mutations. Genetic markers for these and many other diseases  are currently being researched using rapidly developing technologies.


--- Slide 37 ---

Medicine and Healthcare – Genomics – Alteration of Genetic Code

It’s technically possible to analyse and alter genetic code of humans, even before birth, to achieve many goals such as avoid some diseases.
Technical, LEGAL and ETHICAL issues must be overcome for these practices to become mainstream.


--- Slide 38 ---

Medicine and Healthcare – Genomics – Alteration of Genetic Code

The ability to alter genetic code means that people could potentially chose non-life threatening attributes influenced by genetics for their children (eye colour, predisposition for baldness or weight gain etc..)
Genetic editing of human embryos is illegal or restricted in most countries. This area is fraught with ethical concerns and require legal, governmental and societal oversight


--- Slide 39 ---

Tasks -

Computer Science Book pg 281 Task 4
Research some potential future changes in genomics that computing technology many bring about.
Computer Science book pg 293 Task 10.


--- Slide 40 ---

Encryption and Privacy

Encryption refers to the use of algorithms to securely encode a message into a ciphertext.
The recipients have the means to decode the ciphertext back into plaintext
Encryption allows anyone with a computer and special software to encode messages and information


--- Slide 41 ---

Encryption and Privacy

It is becoming more common for web pages to use hypertext transfer protocol secure (https). The visitor to a website using https can be relatively sure they are communicating directly with the intended website. They can be reasonably confident that any information between their computer and the websiteis safe, even if it is intercepted by a malicious actor.


--- Slide 42 ---

Encryption and Privacy

Many popular messaging and social media apps also use encryption to ensure that message sent from one user to another are not readable by anyone who intercepts them
Similarly, industrial and military communications are often encrypted
Many businesses use software on their computers/devices that encrypt all stored data so that if a laptop is stolen, the data can not be accessed without the correct password


--- Slide 43 ---

Encryption and Privacy

These encryptions do not just protect the data with a password but all data is also encrypted (unreadable/scrambled). The password lets the user in but also unscrambles the data so that it makes sense


--- Slide 44 ---

Encryption and the economy

Encryption is also the basis of much of the world’s economy. Online banking and many other transactions rely on some form of encryption


--- Slide 45 ---

Encryption and the economy: Currency

Bitcoin became a household name around 2018. It is one form of cryptocurrency.
Cryptocurrency is any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually (not in physical form) and uses cryptography to secure transactions.


--- Slide 46 ---

Encryption and the economy: Currency

Some advantages of digital currencies compared to physical currency (coins, paper banknotes etc..) include instant transfer, traceability and protection from traditional theft and loss.
Bitcoin is just one of thousands of types of currency.
Cryptocurrency uses decentralized control which means no one person or bank or government can control the transactions or create new units of currency.


--- Slide 47 ---

Encryption and the economy: Currency

The adoption of digital currency has been relatively slow. It is likely that society will continue to move towards digital currencies and away from current systems largely based on fiat currencies where the value is often enforced by a centralised authority.
A weakness of fiat currencies is that its dependent on a centralised authority such as a government and in difficult times such as war, the currency can experience wild fluctuations in value.


--- Slide 48 ---

Encryption and the economy: Currency

Another weakness of fiat currencies is they require large banking systems to facilitate safekeeping, exchange and other services. This makes the use of fiat currencies expensive in comparison to digital currencies.

--- Slide 49 ---

Jobs

Computers have created thousands of job types and millions of individual jobs that a few decades ago, did not exist. Many of these jobs are directly concerned with computing technologies including:
Computer programmers
IT managers
Web designers
Social Media celebrities


--- Slide 50 ---

Jobs

A large number of jobs have also been indirectly created by computing. e.g. the rise in online shopping has led to a massive increase in parcel shipments creating many new jobs in warehousing and distribution
Many jobs have been lost due to changes in technology. Jobs that require routine , repetitive and dangerous tasks such as assembly line work and working with hazardous materials have been eliminated and replaced with automated processes and and robotic solutions


--- Slide 51 ---

Jobs

Retail jobs have been lost due to online shopping
Travel agents have been disrupted by the internet and e-commerce


--- Slide 52 ---

Remote Working

During the pandemic many peoples jobs were saved because of technology. Technology allowed people to carry out their jobds remotely
Shifting to remote working provides flexibility and can preserve jobs but it highlights the importance of everyone having access to high speed broadband.
Remote working can also revitalise rural towns that were struggling to survive pre-pandemic
Remote working also benefits the environment as there is less commuting


--- Slide 53 ---

The Environment

Computing has many substantial direct effects on the environment
Nuclear Weapons Testing using supercomputers One of the most common uses of supercomputers is to accurately test and model the effects of nuclear weapons. Prior to supercomputers, live tests were the only viable option. Live nuclear tests, resulted in destructions of many areas of Earth; the production of tons of nuclear waste; the health of millions of people were affected by these nuclear tests and the displacement of many minorities and marginalised groups of people.


--- Slide 54 ---

The Environment

Computing has many substantial direct effects on the environment
Energy Consumption and reduction :Power consumption has become one of the largest issues of computing technology. Cryptocurrency mining uses more energy than the entire country of Ireland.
Computers enable some processes to be more energy efficient through better control and analysis. E.g. modern electric cards would not be possible without the software that controls them. Electric cars produce fewer emissions and are more energy efficient than traditional cars.


--- Slide 55 ---

Image and facial recognition

There has been a rapid increase in the accuracy and proliferation of image and facial recognition in recent years 
The ability to scan vehicle number plates is used for many purposes: controlling access to carparks; enforcing toll payments ;identifying car owners with outstanding arrest warrants.
Facial recognition systems are now used to: scan airport passengers; provide access to mobile phones; match photos of similar people / family on social media platforms


--- Slide 56 ---

Image and facial recognition

In China, it is now common to pay for goods just by looking at the camera at the til.
Image recognition and classification are used to detect skin cancers and scan people’s retinas (for biometric security/identification as well as disease
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8BzK_LU0E


--- Slide 57 ---

Education – Online Learning

There are vast quantities of online courses, instructional videos and distance and blended learning where students can study almost any subjects, at university level and lower, without leaving the comfort of their own home.
It is common to submit homework online. Many top universities such as Havard, MIT and Standford deliver Massive Online Open Courses (MOOC) with thousands of students . They are mainly free and available worldwide


--- Slide 58 ---

Linguistics and Communication

Speech Interpretation The main barrier to this was a lack of algorithms that could effectively, quickly and accurately interpret human speech. Human speech is extremely vague and confusing. -  	- There are many different ways to say the same thing. 
Words that sound exactly the same, can have different meanings e.g rain, reign, reins, reindeer; two, to, too,


--- Slide 59 ---

Linguistics and Communication

Speech Interpretation As humans we are very good at interpreting the meanings but it is extremely difficult to write programs to correctly interpret speech. Recently, algorithms have been developed, and computers can now interpret speech quite accurately
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6altVgTOf9s


--- Slide 60 ---

Linguistics and Communication

Automatic Translation
One way that computing has affected linguistics is by automatically translating from one language to another. It is now possible to have software on your phone that can translate  between dozens of natural languages in real time. This was only in its infancy a few years ago but it has opened up new travel and international business opportunities for millions of people.


--- Slide 61 ---

Art & Entertainment

Art & entertainment has been radically impacted by computer technology. 
Animated feature films are now entirely dependent on cutting edge technology to produce their content.  Animated films are now COMPLETELY generated by computers. Some of the scenes are so complex that high performance computing software is required to render the images. These films use tens of thousands of computer processors and hundreds of millions of CPU hours. If only a single computer was available, it would take tens of thousands of years to make a single film.


--- Slide 62 ---

Developing Societies, human rights and Equality

One of the greatest promises of computing technology lies in the help it may be able to give developing world. Technology may be able to locate resources such as drinking water, healthcare and education
Digital Divide Computing technology may lead to greater inequality by increasing the gap between those that have easy and affordable access to computers and the internet and those who do not. 
The internet is reshaping our definition of human  rights. Should access to the internet be a human right??


--- Slide 63 ---

Developing Societies, human rights and Equality

The internet is reshaping our definition of human  rights. Should access to the internet be a human right?? Access to the internet can: Affect freedom of speech; enable social mobility; provide the ability to earn an income; facilitate learning about potentially life-threatening matters; provide free access to medical information.


--- Slide 64 ---

Developing Societies, human rights and Equality

Internet access depends on socio-economic status, geographical location, political environment and the local laws. 
In 1999, only 0.04% of the world had internet access. In 2014 it had increased to 40% and by 2020 it was almost 60%
But the ability to access the internet is not the same from country to country


--- Slide 65 ---

Media and social media

The internet and social media can be used to influence people. Fake news can spread easily and quickly and can affect decisions such as :
Selecting which product to chose
Making important health decisions
Determining who to vote for in political elections.


--- Slide 66 ---

Media and social media

Deep fakes are material that artificial intelligence produces to provide fraudulent but credible looking photos, audio clips and video clips. Deep fakes proliferate the internet and have the capacity to misinform and mislead millions.

Microbit Sensors

Accelerometer – a motion sensor that measures movement. The accelerometer in your BBC micro:bit detects when you tilt it left to right, backwards and forwards and up and down.
Temperature Sensor - An input device that measures temperature. The temperature sensor is inside the processor which can give you an approximation of the air temperature.
Light Sensor - An input device that measures light levels. Your micro:bit uses the LEDs to sense the levels of light.


--- Slide 9 ---

Microbit Sensors

Compass – The compass is an input sensor that detects magnetic fields. The micro:bit has an inbuilt compass that can detect the direction in which it is facing.
Touch Logo - The touch logo uses capacitive touch, sensing tiny changes in electrical fields to know when your finger is pressing it - just like your phone or tablet screen.
Microphone - The micro:bit has a built-in microphone. You can use it as a simple input - make your micro:bit turn the lights on when you clap. It can measure the amount of sound


--- Slide 10 ---

Microbit Sensors

Radio - Radio is a way of sending and receiving messages and BBC micro:bits can use radio waves to communicate with each other.
Pins - On the bottom edge of the micro:bit there are 25 gold strips, called pins. These pins allow you create circuits or connect external things like buzzers and motors
Buttons - Buttons are a very common input device. Your micro:bit has two buttons you can program, and a reset button

Variables

A variable is a place where you can store and retrieve data.

Here’s how to define a variable in the Block Editor:
1. From the Variables Toolbox category select ‘Make 
a Variable’ and give your variable a name. 
2. Drag the                                       and place it inside the
on start bracket.

--- Slide 15 ---

Variables (contd)

Complete the following blocks of code and initialise each variable to the value of 0 at the start of the programme.


--- Slide 16 ---

Variables (contd)

> We need to code to update the values at each round of the game. 

Each time the scorekeeper presses button A to record a win for Player A, we want to add 1 to the current value of the variable PlayerAWins. 

We want the same to happen when button B is pressed and also for when button A and B are pressed at the same time.


--- Slide 17 ---

We can code our programme to display an ‘A’, ‘B’ or ‘T’ using the show leds block.
This will give the user visual feedback acknowledging that the user pressed a button. 
Notice that we added a clear screen block after showing ‘A’, ‘B’, or ‘T’.

--- Slide 19 ---

Accelerometer

The micro:bit contains an accelerometer sensor that is able to measure forces applied to the board. On earth, we are subject to the gravity force which pulls us to the ground!
When the micro:bit is flat on a table, with the screen pointing up, the gravity force is aligned with the Z axis of the micro:bit.
If you tilt it up and down, the force will align with the Y axis – this is how we can detect tilting. If the force along Y grows, the micro:bit is tilting more and more vertically.


--- Slide 20 ---

Conditionals

A condition is criteria that the user must meet for a certain function to be carried out.

> What is a condition?

We can add a condition to make code function in certain ways:

A calculator waits for the user in input numbers and a function, before outputting a result
A game waits for the user to press a button at the right time before outputting their score
A quiz waits for the user to choose the correct option, and if they are wrong the quiz will tell the user

> Why use a condition?


--- Slide 21 ---

Conditionals (Contd)

The code inside the if block only runs when the condition block is true. You can compare variables to values or variables to variables, for a true condition.

If you want some other code to run when the opposite condition is true, you put it in an additional block area called else.


--- Slide 22 ---

Block Code

Add an on shake block from the Input Toolbox category to run code when you shake the micro:bit
Create a variable called ‘hand’ and place the set hand to block in the shake event.

Iterations

Iteration (or a loop) is the process of repeating steps.

> What is iteration?

Iteration allows us to simplify our algorithm by stating that 
we will repeat certain steps until told otherwise.

This makes designing algorithms quicker and simpler because 
they don’t have to include lots of unnecessary steps.

> Why use iterations?

What is a computer system?

Computer systems are a combination of both hardware and software working together to achieve a common goal.

A computer system can be described as one that involves interaction between:
Hardware (physical computer, screen, mouse, keyboard etc)
Software (the computer programs e.g. operating system,  Microsoft Word, Google Chrome..)
Data
The human user


--- Slide 4 ---

How Computers Work Introduction

How Computers Work: What Makes a Computer, a Computer? - YouTube


--- Slide 5 ---

Computer Architecture

Computer Architecture is a specification of how a computer’s parts are physically and logically connected.
Computer Architecture is similar to architecture of a house, there are many different designs
Many of today’s computers have a common high-level architecture, that is known as Von Neumann  Architecture


--- Slide 6 ---

Von Neumann  Architecture Introduction

Very early computers could not store programs and, hence, in 1945, John von Neumann developed an idea of a computer that could store programs, which is also known as von Neumann architecture.
He suggested that data and programs could be stored in memory and that the data would be transferred between the memory and the processor during processing. 
The computer architecture he described in 1945 is still relevant today


--- Slide 7 ---

CPU and Von Nuemann Architecture

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbqXqQ-2ixs


--- Slide 8 ---

von Neumann Architecture

Von Neumann architecture contains four main components:
A Central Processing Unit (CPU) which executes instructions
Memory which stores both DATA to be operated on, the INSTRUCTIONS (programs) that operate on the data, and the results.
A Bus connecting the CPU and the memory. This is represented by the pair of arrows (from memory to CPU and back)
Input and Output devices that allow data to come into the computer and results to be sent out.
All the components work together to allow processing of the data and system control.


--- Slide 9 ---

Von Nuemann Architecture


--- Slide 10 ---

Von Neumann Architecture  - CPU

The Control unit (CU) directs/controls the operation of the CPU.
The control unit is responsible for controlling the memory, processor and input-output devices. 
It contains the CIR (Current Instruction Register) and PC (Program Counter) registers. 
The CIR (register) contains the current instruction carried out by the processor. 
The PC contains the location of the next instruction to be executed. 
The control unit reads the instructions from the memory, decodes it and sends control signals to the memory and input-output devices.


--- Slide 11 ---

Von Neumann Architecture - CPU

Arithmetic logic unit (ALU)
The ALU has two main functions:
The ALU is responsible for arithmetic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. and logic operations such as AND, OR, NOT, etc. 
The accumulator register (ACC) stores the results of arithmetic and logical operations performed by a processor.


--- Slide 12 ---

Von Neumann Architecture - CPU

Registers
Register memory is very expensive and the fastest. Registers have a small capacity compared to other types of memory e.g. RAM or ROM
Different processors have different numbers of registers for different purposes. Most have some, or all, of the following:
program counter (PC)
memory address register (MAR)
memory data register (MDR)
current instruction register (CIR)
accumulator (ACC)


--- Slide 13 ---

Von Neumann Architecture - CPU

Registers
Registers -> The Program Counter
Contains the memory location of the next instruction to be executed
CIR (Current Instruction Register) the current instruction being decoded
Accumulator (ACC) - the results of calculations


--- Slide 14 ---

Von Neumann Architecture - CPU

Registers -> Memory Data Registers
Hold data temporarily. This data is operated on by the CPU. This data originally came from memory across the bus and the results will typically be returned to memory.
Registers -> Memory Address Registers
Store memory addresses. This is a value that indicates a specific location in memory. This could be the location in memory of data to be operated on, or results to be sent to memory over the bus.


--- Slide 15 ---

Von Nuemann Architure – Input & Output Devices

An input device, like a keyboard or mouse, converts the signals sent by humans to a form that can be understood by the computer. 
Output devices such as printers, monitors, etc. convert the information from the computer into a form that is understandable by humans.


--- Slide 16 ---

Von Neumann Architecture – Fetch –Decode- Execute Cycle

To carry out the instructions, the processor fetches the data and instructions from the memory and stores it in suitable registers. 
These instructions are decoded and then executed.


--- Slide 17 ---

The Fetch – Execute Cycle


--- Slide 18 ---

The fetch-decode-execute cycle: Fetch

The program counter contains the location of the instruction that is to be executed next. This address is copied to the MAR. 
The instruction is fetched from the memory and copied to the MDR first. 
Then, contents of the MDR are copied to the CIR (Current Instruction Register). 
The value in a program counter is incremented by 1 and, hence, the instruction in the next memory location is processed.


--- Slide 19 ---

The fetch-decode-execute cycle: Decode and execute

Decode
The instructions in the CIR are decoded so that it can be executed.
Execute
The processor sends appropriate control signals to the memory unit and input-output devices in the computer system, according to the decoded instruction.


--- Slide 20 ---

Registers involved in the Fetch –Decode – Execute Cycle


--- Slide 21 ---

Von Neumann Architecture -> The Bus

A bus is a communication pathway that allows data and instructions to travel between different components in a computer. Think of it as a collection of wires that allow data and instructions to move from memory to the CPU and back.
There are many buses on the motherboard. The speed of a bus is measured in megahertz (MHz). The faster the bus, the faster data is communicated. The speed of the motherboard is defined by the bus speed.
Buses are limited by their width in bits. They are usually 8, 16 or 32-bits wide. This tells us how many bits can be sent by the bus at any one time, eg a 32-bit bus can send 32 bits at once.

--- Slide 24 ---

Let’s review some concepts

Buses
The connection between the processor, memory, and input-output devices.

Processor
The processor contains ALU (Arithmetic and Logic unit) and Control Unit (CU).

CIR (Current Instruction register)
The CIR contains the current instruction carried out by the processor

PC (Program Counter)
The PC contains the location of the instruction that is to be executed next.

Accumulator 
Accumulator (ACC) is the register that stores the results of arithmetic and logical operations performed by the processor.


--- Slide 25 ---

Von Neumann Architecture - Memory

Early computers could not store programs internally. Programs had to be stored externally on punch cards, magnetic tapes or floppy disks.
Modern computers store programs internally in memory.


--- Slide 26 ---

Primary Memory - RAM

RAM is PRIMARY Memory
Random Access Memory (RAM) is known as volatile memory. If the computer loses power, the data in RAM is lost. RAM is fast compared to other memory that is not volatile.
RAM holds the data and instructions of the program that is currently being executed by the CPU. 
RAM is not where files are stored for long-term use, e.g photos on your computer. They are stored in secondary memory.


--- Slide 27 ---

Primary Memory - ROM

ROM read only memory is non-volatile. Its contents remain stored whether the computer is powered on or not. A typical use of ROM is to store the computer’s BIOS (Basic input/output system) which is the software responsible for booting up the system. When computer is turned on, BIOS performs the necessary checks and then hands control over to the operating system


--- Slide 28 ---

Memory

Memory used to store information for immediate use by the CPU is also referred to as main memory or primary storage. RAM and ROM are both types of primary storage
How computer memory works
BBC Bitesize Revision - CPU & Memory


--- Slide 29 ---

System Archtecture - CPU

Cache
Cache is a small amount of high-speed random access memory (RAM) built directly within the processor. It is used to temporarily hold data and instructions that the processor is likely to reuse. This allows for faster processing, as the processor does not have to wait for the data and instructions to be fetched from the RAM.


--- Slide 30 ---

Factors Determining the Speed of the CPU

Even though today's processors are tremendously fast, their performance can be affected by a number of factors including:

clock speed
Number of cores
- Cache size
- RAM


--- Slide 31 ---

Factors Determining the Speed of the CPU

Number of cores. A processing unit within a CPU is known as a core. Each core is capable of fetching, decoding and executing its own instructions. The more cores a CPU has, the greater the number of instructions it can process in a given space of time.


--- Slide 32 ---

Factors Determining the Speed of the CPU

Clock speed. Clock speed is the number of pulses the CPU’s clock generates per second. It is measured in hertz. The more pulses per second, the more fetch-decode-execute cycles that can be performed and the more instructions that are processed in a given space of time.


--- Slide 33 ---

Factors Determining the Speed of the CPU

Cache. A cache is a fast, relatively small capacity set of locations that is built directly within the processor. Cache is used to store the instructions and data that the processor is most likely to need and reuse. The bigger its cache, the less time a processor has to wait for instructions to be fetched. 


--- Slide 34 ---

Factors Determining the Speed of the CPU

RAM. This is the short-term memory of the computer that holds all of the programs and data currently being ran by the computer. Having more memory means that the data and instructions that need to be processed will not have to be fetched from secondary storage (which is a much slower process). 
Temperature. If CPU gets too hot performance will decrease.


--- Slide 35 ---

Factors affecting the speed of a CPU

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS1rEJZKr4U


--- Slide 36 ---

Von Neumann Architecture -> Secondary Storage

Secondary devices are used to store data persistently.  They store information regardless of whether the computer is turned on or not. It is non-volatile memory, unlike RAM that is volatile.


--- Slide 37 ---

Differences between Primary and Secondary storage

Primary storage stores information for immediate use by the CPU while secondary storage stores data that can be used at any time.
Primary storage stores data temporarily (apart from ROM), whereas secondary storage stores data persistently
Primary storage is faster than secondary storage


--- Slide 38 ---

Differences between Primary and Secondary storage

Primary storage is more expensive than secondary storage per unit, such as megabyte(MB) or gigabyte (GB).
Primary storage is smaller ( less capacity)


--- Slide 39 ---

Secondary storage

A typical modern personal computer can store up to several terabytes (TB). RAM is in the order of several or several dozen gigabytes (GB)
Secondary storage are normally hard drives. There are 2 types of hard drives magnetic and solid state disk (SSD). Magnetic hard drives are more common.
Magnetic hard disks contain a magnetic platter that turns at a very high speed. A head moves across the spinning platter and reads information


--- Slide 40 ---

Secondary storage

Solid State Disks (SSD) is becoming more widespread. These are faster and more durable than magnetic disks because they have no moving parts. Most SSD are based on flash memory. Flash memory is what USB memory stick are based on.
SSD are expensive but the price is falling


--- Slide 41 ---


--- Slide 42 ---

Speed & Cost of Memory


--- Slide 43 ---

The closer a memory type is to the CPU, the quicker the CPU can access the instructions and execute them. However, the closer it is to the CPU the smaller and more expensive it is. Each type of memory is limited by their speed, size, cost and position in relation to the CPU.

Memory Overview


--- Slide 44 ---

The Motherboard

BBC Bitesize Revision Motherboard
The motherboard is a circuit board that devices are physically mounted on.
It connects the CPU to the memory and all the other hardware. The CPU sits on the motherboard
Motherboard’s typically include: CPU, main memory, hard drive and many other components such as I/O devices.
When you plug in a USB device into a computer, you are physically connecting to the mother board


--- Slide 45 ---

Operating Systems

An operating system (or 'OS') controls the general operation of a computer, and provides an easy way for us to interact with computers and run applications.

The OS runs runs all the time in the background
Every computer has an OS. They could not run without it.


--- Slide 46 ---

Operating Systems

There are a few common operating systems available:
Mac OS X - operating system for Macs
Linux, Ubuntu, Unix  – based on Unix
Windows
Android (based on Linux)
Apple iOS


--- Slide 47 ---

Functions of the Operating Systems

The operating system performs several key functions:
interface - provides a user interface so it is easy to interact with the computer, known as “user interface”
manages the CPU - runs applications and executes and cancels processes
multi-tasks - allows multiple applications to run at the same time
Manages memory - transfers programs into and out of memory, allocates free space between programs, and keeps track of memory usage


--- Slide 48 ---

Functions of the Operating Systems

The operating system performs several key functions:
5. 	Manages peripherals - opens, closes and writes to peripheral devices such as storage attached to the computer
6.	 organises - creates a file system to organise files and directories and manages it
7. 	security - provides security through user accounts and passwords
8.	utilities - provides tools for managing and organising hardware


--- Slide 49 ---

Operating Systems Functions – User Interface

User interface
A user interface is the means by which the user provides input to a computer and the computer conveys output to the user. Specifically, it is the point of interaction between a user and a computer through the use of input / output devices. 
The UI is either graphical or text-based.
Graphical user interface (GUI)
The OS on most computers and smartphones provides an environment with tiles, icons and/or menus. This type of interface is called the graphical user interface (GUI) because the user interacts with images through a mouse, keyboard or touchscreen.


--- Slide 50 ---

Operating Systems – User Interface

Command line interface (CLI)
An OS also provides a method of interaction that is non-graphical, called the command line interface (CLI). This is a text-only service with feedback from the OS appearing in text. Using a CLI requires knowledge of the commands available on a particular machine.
Advantages of using the command line include:
a faster way to get tasks done
it is more flexible than a GUI
it uses less memory
Some games, such as Minecraft, also make use of a command line tool which allows the user to bypass the main interface and alter the game’s mechanics or environment.

===== 12 - Computational Thinking.pptx =====


--- Slide 1 ---

Computational Thinking

Chapter 7


--- Slide 2 ---

What is Computational Thinking

Computational thinking allows us to take a complex problem, understand what the problem is and develop possible solutions.
 The term computational thinking was popularized by Professor Jeannette Wing. Wing defined computational thinking as “the thought processes involved in formulating problems and their solutions so that the solutions are represented in a form that can be effectively carried out by an information processing agent”


--- Slide 3 ---

Computational Thinking

Computational thinking involves four key techniques or “pillars”: 
Pattern Matching – identifying patterns and recognizing when two patterns are similar
Abstraction – ignoring irrelevant details and reducing a problem to its essential features
Decomposition – Breaking a complex problem down into smaller and more simpler tasks and then solving each one individually
Algorithms – using a sequence of steps to solved a problem


--- Slide 4 ---

Computational Thinking

A complex problem is one that, at first glance, we don't know how to solve easily.
Computational thinking involves taking that complex problem and breaking it down into a series of small, more manageable problems (decomposition). Each of these smaller problems can then be looked at individually, considering how similar problems have been solved previously (pattern recognition) and focusing only on the important details, while ignoring irrelevant information (abstraction). Next, simple steps or rules to solve each of the smaller problems can be designed (algorithms).
Finally, the algorithms are used to program a computer to help solve the complex problem in the best way


--- Slide 5 ---

Decomposition

Decomposition is breaking a complex problem down into smaller and more simpler tasks and then solving each one individually.
It is a way of thinking about artefacts in terms of their component parts.


--- Slide 6 ---

Decomposition

For example, making breakfast can be broken down, or decomposed, into separate activities such as make toast; make tea; boil egg; etc.  Each of these, in turn, might also be broken down into a set of steps.
Consider developing a game: different people can design and create the different levels independently, provided that key aspects are agreed in advance. A simple arcade level might also be decomposed into several parts, such as the life-like motion of a character, scrolling the background and setting the rules about how characters interact.


--- Slide 7 ---

Decomposition (Exam Question Ordinary)


--- Slide 8 ---

Decomposition (Exam Question Ordinary)


--- Slide 9 ---

Pattern Matching

identifying patterns, similarities and connections, and exploiting those features. It is a way of quickly solving new problems based on previous solutions to problems. 
Asking questions such as “Is this similar to a problem I’ve already solved?” and “How is it different?” are important here, as is the process of recognising patterns both in the data being used and the processes/strategies being used.  Algorithms that solve some specific problems can be adapted to solve a whole class of similar problems..


--- Slide 10 ---

Pattern Matching (Example)

A pupil uses a floor turtle to draw a series of shapes, such as a square and a triangle.  The pupil writes a computer program to draw the two shapes.  They then want to draw an octagon and a 10-sided shape.  From the work with the square and triangle, they spot that there is a relationship between the number of sides in the shape and the angles involved.  They can then write an algorithm that expresses this relationship and use it to draw any regular polygon.

Abstraction

Abstraction – ignoring irrelevant details and reducing a problem to its essential features
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-7Hy-PF2Q


--- Slide 20 ---

Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of making an artefact more understandable through reducing the unnecessary detail. A classic example is the London Underground map. London is a highly complex system. The London Underground map is a highly refined abstraction with just sufficient information for the traveller to navigate the underground network without the unnecessary burden of information such as distance and exact geographic position. It is a representation that contains precisely the information necessary to plan a route from one station to another – and no more!


--- Slide 21 ---

Abstraction


--- Slide 22 ---

Using Abstraction when designing programs

Defining functions is a very good example of how abstraction can be achieved when designing programs
E.g. the print() function. The programmer knows what it does and how to use it. The program doesn’t need to know the technical details of exactly how the argument you provide the print function ends up on the screen. These details are “abstracted away” by the function

Algorithms

An algorithm is a sequence of steps required to solve a problem
Abstraction is a key concern when designing a new algorithm. The level of detail required (level of abstraction) depends on the application of the end program. Designing an algorithm for a robot vacuum cleaner to move around a room in a house requires a different level of abstraction to designing an algorithm to ensure that a self-driving car can travel safely on a street


--- Slide 28 ---

Algorithms

Algorithms for computers must meet the following criteria:
Be specific and clear. Every detail and every possibility must be accounted for because computers can’t guess or rely on previous experience
Consist of a finite number of steps. The algorithm must terminate (no infinite loops)
Have a clear flow of control from beginning to end

Digital Computer

In everyday life, we use numbers based on combinations of the digits between 0 and 9. This counting system is known as decimal or base 10.
Try this with 83678
And 98438


--- Slide 4 ---

Digital Computer

Computers use 1s and 0s to represent the flow of electricity
	1 is used to show the electricity is flowing, and 0 shows that it is not flowing.
All data we want to the computer to process must be converted into binary code (1s an 0s)
Each 1 or 0 in a binary code is a bit (binary digit). For example 1010 is 4 bits.


--- Slide 5 ---

Digital Computer Transistors

The circuits in a computer's processor are made up of billions of transistors. A transistor is a tiny switch that is activated by the electronic signals it receives. The digits 1 and 0 used in binary reflect the on and off states of a transistor.

Sometimes, during binary arithmetic you will get a result that requires MORE bits than the CPU is expecting – this is called OVERFLOW.
E.g. the 8 bit calculation 11111111 + 00000001 gives the 9-bit answer 100000000. Computers will see the 1 as an overflow error and just output 00000000 as the result, which is nonsense.


--- Slide 27 ---

Overflow Errors –

Computers usually deal with these extra bits by storing them elsewhere. Overflow flags are used to show an overflow error has occurred
Overflow errors lead to a loss of data and a loss of accuracy in your answer. It can also cause software to crash if it doesn’t have a way of dealing with the extra bit.


--- Slide 28 ---

Binary Shift –

A binary shift moves every bit in a binary number to the left or right a certain number of places
Gaps at the beginning or end are filled in with 0s
The direction of the binary shift indicates whether it multiplies or divides the binary number.

Hexadecimal code

Hexadecimal code or “Hex” are base 16 numbers
We use 0-9 for the 1st 10 digits and then A-F as the symbols for the other 6. All hexadecimal numbers are made of a combination of these digits.


--- Slide 33 ---

Hexadecimal code

Hexadecimal or base 16 uses 16 different digits
A single hex character can represent any decimal number from 0 – 15
To represent 0 – 15 in binary requires 4 bits (nibble), so each hex character equates to a 4 bits in binary
Programmers prefer hex when coding 
	because – its simpler to remember large
	numbers in hex (they’re shorter)
	- It’s easier to convert between binary 
	and hex than binary and decimal.


--- Slide 34 ---

Converting from Hexadecimal to Decimal code


--- Slide 35 ---

Converting from Decimal to Hexadecimal

Similar to method for converting decimal to binary.
Step 1: Divide the given decimal number by 16 and note down the remainder.
Step 2: Now, divide the obtained quotient by 16, and note the remainder again.
Step 3: Repeat the above steps until you get 0 as the quotient.
Step 4: Now, write the remainders in such a way that the last remainder is written first, followed by the rest in the reverse order.


--- Slide 36 ---

Converting from Decimal to Hexadecimal


--- Slide 37 ---

Converting from Hex to binary

Hex is very easy to convert to binary.
Write down the hex number and represent each hex digit by its binary equivalent number from the table above.
Use 4 digits and add insignificant leading zeros if the binary number has less than 4 digits. E.g. Write 102 (2 decimal) as 00102.
Then concatenate or string all the digits together.
Discard any leading zeros at the left of the binary number.


--- Slide 38 ---

Converting from binary to hex

Start from the least significant bit (LSB) at the right of the binary number and divide it up into groups of 4 bits. 
Convert each group of 4 bits to its equivalent hex value.
Concatenate the results together, giving the total hex number.

Binary Code and electrical signals

Modern computers use binary code to represent all information. 
We represent binary code using symbol pairs, the most common pair is (0,1)
All binary system have TWO and only TWO possible values. 
In a computer, these are physically represented by the presence of or lack of presence of, an electric signal


--- Slide 3 ---

Binary Code and electrical signals

These electrical signal is often referred to as “on” (signal present) and “off” (no signal present).
This is a simple concept and one of the fundamental strengths of modern digital, electronic, binary computer, which almost all computers now are.


--- Slide 4 ---

Binary Code and electrical signals

Analogue signals
Music and speech vary continuously in frequency and amplitude. In the same way, analogue signals can vary in frequency, amplitude, or both. FM (Frequency Modulated) and AM (Amplitude Modulated) are two types of radio signals. The diagram shows a typical oscilloscope trace of an analogue signal.


--- Slide 5 ---

Binary Code and electrical signals

Digital signals
Digital signals are a series of pulses consisting of two states: ON (1) or OFF (0). There are no values in between. DAB (Digital Audio Broadcast) radio is transmitted as digital signals. The diagram shows a typical oscilloscope trace of a digital signal.

Electricity and electrons

Electricity
Electricity is a form of energy arising from the movements of electrons.
Electrons are negatively charged particles found in every atom.
The CPU, memory, bus and all other components are all electronic devices.
They work by controlling the flow of electrons through the device.


--- Slide 8 ---

Electric Current

Current
Electric current is the flow of electrons from one place to another. The greater the rate of electron flow, the greater the current there is.


--- Slide 9 ---

Voltage

Voltage
An electron will not move without voltage. Voltage is electrical force that causes electrons to flow. 
Voltage is the measure of the difference in electrical energy between two parts of a circuit. The bigger the difference in energy, the bigger the voltage.


--- Slide 10 ---

Voltage
In this circuit a voltage exists between each end of the battery. The electrons will flow along the connecting wire, lighting up the bulb i.e. a current flows through the circuit.
The current can only flow if there is a complete circuit (no break) from the battery through the wires and back to the battery again


--- Slide 11 ---

Resistance

Resistance
Is a measure of how much a material resists (or obstructs) the flow of electrons (current).
Different materials have different resistances to the flow of electrons.
Copper (an electrical conductor) has very low resistance and glass (an electrical insulator) has very high resistance. Gold is an excellent conductor as it has extremely low resistance.


--- Slide 12 ---

Basic electronic devices - Resistor

Resistors
A resistor is a device that reduces current flow
A kettle is like a big resistor. Its difficult for the electricity to flow through the kettle’s element. This creates heat that causes the water to boil.
Resistors have different values. Many resistors have colour bands on them that indicate their resistance value.

Resistors have different values. Many resistors have colour bands on them that indicate their resistance value.


--- Slide 14 ---

Basic electronic devices - Transistor

Transistor
Transistors are tiny electronic switches 
Transistor is an electronic switch within a circuit that allows a small current change to “switch” on or off a larger current


--- Slide 15 ---

Basic electronic devices - Capacitor

A capacitor stores electrical energy in the form of electrical charge. Unlike batteries, capacitors do not store electrical energy for long periods of time.
Capacitors are often used in volatile memory (RAM)


--- Slide 16 ---

Basic electronic devices - Capacitor

You can see a capacitor in action when you turn off certain electronic devices. When you press the power off button, the light that tells you the system is on, stays on for a few seconds, but then dims before going out. This is the capacitor discharging.


--- Slide 17 ---

Basic electronic devices - Capacitor

Capacitors also found in touchscreens. When you touch the screen, it changes the amount of charge at that point because your skin is a weak electrical conductor. The change in charge is very small but enough to be detected by the device
Capacitors are often used in series with resistors to achieve a time delay. The time it takes for the capacitor to become charged is related to the size of the capacitor and the value of the regulating resistor.


--- Slide 18 ---

The CPU and logic gates

Binary code is represented by electrical signals in the computer.
Different devices (resistors, capacitors, transistors etc..) manipulate the flow of these signals in different ways
In the CPU, the TRANSISTOR is responsible for manipulating the binary code (strings of 0s and 1s)
The transistor acts as a switch. If the transistor is switched to “on” electrical current can flow, represented by 1.
If the switch is “off”, the electrical flow stops and is represented by 0.


--- Slide 19 ---

The CPU and logic gates

Many of the instructions that a CPU must carry out are based on Boolean operators, such as and, or , not
Transistors can be arranged in different ways to carry out Boolean (logic) operations on data. These arrangements of transistors into circuits are known as Logic Gates
Logic gates allow the CPU to carry out Boolean operations on binary code, by controlling the flow of electricity, represented by 1s and 0s.


--- Slide 20 ---

The CPU and logic gates

A CPU is mainly made up of lots of combinations of logic gates, with each type of gate consisting of a particular circuit of transistors. There are billions of transistors in the CPU.


--- Slide 21 ---

Logic Gates –> and gate

This is a diagram of an and gate, which can be constructed from a few transistors.
An and gate, has 2 inputs -> A & B, and one output, Y. 
The table is called a truth table. It shows the values of Y (output), for all possible combinations of input values A and B, for an and gate.


--- Slide 22 ---

Logic Gates –> or gate

This is a diagram of an or gate, 
An or gate, has 2 inputs -> A & B, and one output, Y. 
This is the truth table for an or gate


--- Slide 23 ---

Logic Gates –> not gate

This is a diagram of a not gate, 
A not gate, has 1 inputs -> A, and one output, Y. 
The output is the inverse (opposite) of the input.
If A is 1, the output is 0
This is the truth table for a not gate


--- Slide 24 ---

Logic Gates –> nand gate

This is a diagram of an nand gate,
A nand gate, has 2 inputs -> A & B, and one output, Y. 
A nand gate is the same as an and gate followed by a not gate.
This means the output of a nand gate is the opposite of the output of an and gate


--- Slide 25 ---

Logic Gates –> nor gate

This is a diagram of an nor gate,
A nor gate, has 2 inputs -> A & B, and one output, Y. 
A nor gate is the same as an or gate followed by a not gate.
This means the output of a nor gate is the opposite of the output of an or gate


--- Slide 26 ---

Combining Logic Gates

Logic gates can be combined to make logic circuits.
The logic circuit in this diagram shows the output Q from a not gate being used as one of the inputs to an and gate.
This can be written as a Boolean expression :
P = (not A) and B


--- Slide 27 ---

Combining Logic Gates

Calculate the output P, for any combinations of A and B, using a Truth Table
Step 1:Start with a blank Truth Table and include an intermediate output Q


--- Slide 28 ---

Combining Logic Gates

Step 2: Enter all the possible combinations of inputs A and B into the truth table


--- Slide 29 ---

Combining Logic Gates

Step 3: Work out the intermediate output Q for each combination of input A to the NOT gate


--- Slide 30 ---

Combining Logic Gates

Step 4: Use the input value B and Q, calculate the values of P.    
P = B AND Q


--- Slide 31 ---

Logic Diagrams based on Boolean expressions

Logic diagrams can be drawn based on Boolean expressions.
Let’s draw :
Y = (A and B) or not C
Step 1: Working backwards from the output Y, we know that Y results from a combination of 2 inputs to an or gate.
Draw an or gate with output Y and 2 intermediate inputs P and Q. Leave room on the Lefthand side for other gates.


--- Slide 32 ---

Logic Diagrams based on Boolean expressions

Logic diagrams can be drawn based on Boolean expressions.
Let’s draw :

Data Analytics

LC Computer Science


--- Slide 2 ---

What is Data Analytics

Data Analytics involves processing and analysing data with the aim of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making
Data Analytics in Football


--- Slide 3 ---


--- Slide 4 ---

Stages of Analytics

Accessing the Data
Pre-processing the data
Analysis
Visualisation


--- Slide 5 ---

Stage 1 - Accessing the Data

Data describes the raw data in formats such as a CSV file, a list or data in a database.
The Data is normally not in an organised structure so it is impossible to gain any useful information from it


--- Slide 6 ---

Stage 1 – A CSV file


--- Slide 7 ---

Stage 2 - Pre-processing the data

This stage involves converting the data into a form that is suitable for further analysis.
Techniques include:
Checking for outliers and missing data
Sorting data


--- Slide 8 ---

Stage 2 – Outliers and missing data

An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other data points. Must decide either to keep them or remove them from the data set.
Missing data can cause problems and have a significant effect on the conclusion drawn from the data. Missing data points can be removed from the data set during pre-processing


--- Slide 9 ---

Stage 3 – Analysis

Even when data is presented graphically, the finer details are not always obvious.
Algorithms can offer greater precision to those interpreting the data
Using algorithm to calculate frequency, mean, median, mode, minimum, maximum can add clarity and produce information that is easy to understand.


--- Slide 10 ---

Stage 4 – Visualisation

Once the data is pre-processed, it can be presented as meaningful information. This is normally presenting the data visually in a graph or picture.
Visualisation can be carried out before or after pre-processing and analysis


--- Slide 11 ---

Accessing the Data -

In this part we will look at code to read in, store & retrieve data from files stored on you computer


--- Slide 12 ---

Accessing the Data – Python Lists

Most analysis such as frequency, mean, medium, minimum, maximum and mode can only be calculated on data held in a list. 
Once the data is in a list, it’s possible to perform pre-processing
myList=[1, 19, 27, 8, 1, 5, 9]


--- Slide 13 ---

Accessing the Data – Text Files

A text file is a type of computer file that only contain plain text. There is no formatting or images. Text files have the extension .txt
Text files are widely used to hold data. 
They are the most versatile type of file as they allow for storing data after your program finishes


--- Slide 14 ---

Creating, writing to and closing a text file

When writing to a file using Python if the file does not exist, Python automatically creates it.
When reading from a file, if the file does not exist, you get an error.


--- Slide 15 ---

Creating, writing to and closing a text file

Line 1: file is just a variable name
open() takes 2 arguments
The first is a string that contains the filename including its extension
The second argument refers to what we are doing with the file


--- Slide 16 ---

Creating, writing to and closing a text file

Line 1: file is just a variable name
open() takes 2 arguments
The first is a string that contains the filename including its extension
The second argument refers to what we are doing with the file
“w” – write. This overwrites any previous contents
“a” – append. The text is added to the end of what is currently in the file
“r” – read. The text is read from the file as a string


--- Slide 17 ---

Read in contents of text file

Differences from last code
“r” indicates that the file is to be read
Variable dataIn used to store all the contents of the file that is read using file.read()


--- Slide 18 ---

Accessing the Data – CSV file

Text files are useful but are not very suitable for storing numerical data, such as multiple temperature readings
There is no standard way to separate each value in a text file so a computer can read each value separately.
CSV files are used to store numerical data. Commas are used to separate data items.
File extension is .csv


--- Slide 19 ---

Create a CSV file

Create a file in excel and open it
Enter 5 numbers in adjacent cells in the first row
Save as a .csv file and open it using notepad, not excel


--- Slide 20 ---

Advantages of CSV files

Python can read and write to them quickly (same as text file)
Excel has a limit on the number of rows it can have. This may not be big enough for some uses.
Many applications can open and work with CSV files so you can use the file even if you do not have excel.


--- Slide 21 ---

Creating, writing to and reading a CSV file

The code is identical to the text file except for the filename/extension


--- Slide 22 ---

Reading a CSV file

The variable dataIn is of type String. When reading a CSV file, the file.read() function reads in the characters as a single string. Some analysis such as the mean, cant be performed on strings


--- Slide 23 ---

Reading a CSV file

The variable dataIn is of type String. When reading a CSV file, the file.read() function reads in the characters as a single string. Some analysis such as the mean, cant be performed on strings


--- Slide 24 ---

Extracting CSV file to a list

A list is created from the string using the .split() function. The items in the list are still a string


--- Slide 25 ---

Extracting CSV file to a list

A list is created from the string using the .split() function. The items in the list are still a string


--- Slide 26 ---

Converting string list to int

Line 9 - item is a variable name that appears twice. Must be the same in both locations. Uses square brackets to show its returning a list


--- Slide 27 ---

Practice time

Using the code on the previous page
	- create a new .csv file called newCSV.csv and insert 5 float vales into the 	file.
	- Use the .split function to convert the .csv file to a list
	- Convert the values from string to float
	- Print out the list


--- Slide 28 ---

Pre-processing Data - Sorting

During this stage we apply techniques to ensure the data is of good quality
SORTING ASCENDING AND DESCENDING

Line 2 – list gets sorted ascending
Line 4 – list get sorted descending


--- Slide 29 ---

Practice Time- 15 mins

Page 77 Task 2
Create a text file (in the same folder as your python script file) that contain s a single word that will act as a password. You can select the password

Task 3
Write a python program to ask a user to enter a password. Check whether the entered password is the same as the password in the text file.

Task 4
Write a python program to ask the user to enter 10 values using a loop. You can assume the values are numbers. Save these values to a .csv file
HINT: you will need to add the commas in the program to convert the data to.csv format or you can use the append argument


--- Slide 30 ---

Pre-processing Data – Removing Data

If item in list is identified as an outlier or invalid, it can be removed

.remove() function will remove all instances of that specific value in the list.


--- Slide 31 ---

Pre-processing Data – Removing Data

Sometimes removing data is not a good option especially if a list is been used with other lists


--- Slide 32 ---

Pre-processing Data – Removing Data

We removed the erroneous data in numbs using the .remove() function
The order in numBS has changed by removing the missing values. The number of brother and sister no longer match up with the student names correctly
There is also 2 instances of missing data


--- Slide 33 ---

Pre-processing Data – Imputation

Imputation involves replacing missing or erroneous data with alternative values
One imputation algorithm finds the average of all the non-missing and non-erroneous values and then replaces each missing value with the average


--- Slide 34 ---

Pre-processing Data – Imputation

This is useful because:
It keep the list the same size and keeps the location of each item
The code for the algorithm is easily modified to impute other values, beside the average, depending on the context
Imputation used for scientific and statistical work where it is not practical for people to check each data point


--- Slide 35 ---

Imputation-Step 1

Imputation involves replacing missing or erroneous data with alternative values. Step 1 - find the average of the non-erroneous data


--- Slide 36 ---

Imputation-Step 2

Step 2 – Replace all error values with calculated averageNonErroneous


--- Slide 37 ---

Practice Time- 10 mins

Page 79  - Task 1
Create a python program to remove items from a list using a loop

Page 79  - Task 2
Create a list of 20 numeric items, then:
	- Sort the file in descending order
	- Save it as a .csv file
	-Find the largest and the smallest number in the list (without using max or min function)


--- Slide 38 ---

--- Slide 43 ---

Stages of Analytics -> Analysis

Python is very popular for analytics because of the speed of writing python code to analyse data.
import statistics has functions for minimum, maximum, mean, median, frequency and mode.


--- Slide 44 ---

Analysis - Minimium

myList=[1, 9, 27, 8, 1, 5, 9]
Minimium => The smallest value on the list

Sort the list in ascending order: [1, 1, 5, 8, 9, 9, 27]
Find the middle number: [1, 1, 5, 8, 9, 9, 27]
If you have an even set of numbers, average the middle two to find the median. For example, the median of this set of numbers is 28.5 (28 + 29 / 2).
23, 24, 26, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34

--- Slide 67 ---

Stages of Analytics -> Visualisation

Visualisation helps us to understand the data
Visualisation is the visual representation of the data using graphs and charts.
We will use the module matplotlib


--- Slide 68 ---

Stages of Analytics -> Visualisation

The import uses pyplot from the matplotlib module. This is used for to create simple graphs/charts.
matplotlib.pyplot is assigned the shorter name plt


--- Slide 69 ---

Stages of Analytics -> Visualisation

In this example plt.plot takes in 1 list as an argument, myList. 
It can take in more than one list. e.g  plt.plot(names,numBS)
The .plot() uses the values in myList as the y-axis values.
In this example, there are no x-axis values, the pyplot interface uses the list index number 0,1,2,3 ….etc as the x values


--- Slide 70 ---

Stages of Analytics -> Simple Plot with no Labels


--- Slide 71 ---

Visualisation – Labelling the graph


--- Slide 72 ---

Visualisation – Simple Plot with Labels


--- Slide 73 ---

Visualisation – Options

Sometime a line is not suitable for what you want to display.
A line between point suggests the data is linked in some way
The following code plots the points without any connecting lines


--- Slide 74 ---

Visualisation – Options


--- Slide 75 ---

Visualisation – Options

The line style consists of two or three characters. The first represents the colour and the second/third indicates the point style


--- Slide 76 ---

Visualisation – Working with the X and Y axis

If no x-axis labels are supplied by the coder, pyplot uses the index of the list for the x-axis values. How could we get the students’ names on the graph?


--- Slide 77 ---

Visualisation – Working with the X and Y axis

To get the names of students onto the graph, use another list`. In this example called names


--- Slide 78 ---

Visualisation – Working with the X and Y axis

The first argument in .plot() is the list names. This represents the x-axis labels.
The second argument in .plot() is the list numBS. This represents the y-axis values.


--- Slide 79 ---

Visualisation – names used as x-axis labels
numBS is y-axis values


--- Slide 80 ---

Tasks Pg 88

Task 1 -> Create a list of 20 numerical values, then:
Create a plot
Add a y-axis label
Add a title
Show the plot
Save the plot image
Task 3 -> Create a python program with 2 lists, one containing the names of 6 students and the other containing the heights of the 6 students in meters.
Create a plot with red dots (not the default blue line) with the heights on the y-axis and the names on the x-axis. Add a title and show the plot.
Task 4 -> Repeat the above but create a barchart


--- Slide 81 ---

Visualisation – Barchart


--- Slide 82 ---

Visualisation – Barchart

The first argument in .bar() is the list names. This represents the x-axis labels.
The second argument in .bar() is the list numBS. This represents the y-axis values.

Visualisation – Display 3 data sets on the same graph

It can be useful to have 2 or more plots overlayed on the same graph. 
This allows us to compare both plots and examine any trends or relationships that may be there.
When comparing 3 lists, we assume that the items at each list index position correspond with each other. For example, the items at list indices control[0], fertil1[0] and fertil2[0] are assumed to all correspond to 7days;  control[1], fertil1[1] and fertil2[1] all correspond to 14 days etc.

The Brief:

Hypothesising, making predictions, examining evidence, recognising patterns and reaching conclusions are at the heart of Computer Science. In this applied learning task, students will identify an interdisciplinary topic, develop a hypothesis and utilise existing resources to highlight the salient information and inform future decisions. By identifying, analysing, and deconstructing a problem, students will deepen their understanding of core practices and principles of Computer Science.

The Task

First identify an interdisciplinary topic where data analytics would be useful. This might mean collecting data for a scientific experiment, looking at population statistics, historical data, vocabulary use in English, surveying your classmates or even analysing social media posts. These are just a few ideas, look across your other subjects and you're likely to have lots of options. Remember you're looking for datasets that you can find the mean, median, mode and frequency of. Idealy It's best to choose something you'd like to gain a better insight into, that's where data analytics is most useful!


--- Slide 96 ---

Step 1:

Define the topic, data source and make a hypothesis.


Brainstorm a few ideas for topics with your team before you decide on your topic:

Step 1:

Define the topic, find your data source and make a hypothesis.
Find your data source

--- Slide 98 ---

Step 1:

Define the topic, find your data source and make a hypothesis.
Describe the data source, where you got it from and where you stored it.
Example:
focusireland.ie. The number of homeless people in Ireland over the course of 3 years from November 2014 - November 2017. Stored in a .csv file in the same folder as the Python Script.


--- Slide 99 ---

Step 1:

Define the topic, find your data source and make a hypothesis.
Make a hypothesis:

An Example: The number of people that are homeless in Ireland has been steadily increasing over the past few years from November 2014 - November 2017 Our hypothesis is that homelessness is steadily increasing annually.

Break down the problem into sequential steps that need to be achieved to complete this task.

Recommended order:
-Source, Collect, Clean and Transform Data
-Algorithms for Processing Data 
-Data Visualisation 
- Data Interpretation

Step 2:

Step 2:   Source, Collect, Clean and Transform Data

Now that you have selected your topic it's time to gather/collect data. Make sure to save the data somewhere safe so that you have access to it (if it's not that big you can add it as an addition on your webpage

Once you have your data it might need to be cleaned prior to analysis. What format is it currently stored in, .xlsx, .csv, .txt, does it need conversion? Are there characters/symbols you need to remove? Would the data be best stored in a list  ?


--- Slide 102 ---

Step 2:

Step 2:   Source, Collect, Clean and Transform Data

Outline the methods and functions you used to clean and transform your raw data (this can include using desktop applications and/or coding techniques), excel etc.
Example:
The dataset was large. We removed any rows we did not need from the dataset using MS Excel. We then used MS Excel to remove dollar signs and  commas in numerical data.  We read the .csv file and then split it into separate integers (in a list) ready for finding the averages.


--- Slide 103 ---

Step 3:

Step 3:   Algorithms for Data Processing

Describe the algorithms you used and why? 

Example:
We used the mean and median algorithms in the program as they were the most relevant to the data


--- Slide 104 ---

Step 4:

Step 4:   Visualisation

Describe the graphical output type you chose and why? 
Include an images of the charts / graphs.
Now that you have your data processed it's time to visualise it to make it easier to interpret. There are many ways to visualise your data, be sure to choose the options that will make analysing the data easiest.


--- Slide 105 ---

Step 4:

Step 4:   Data Interpretation

Now that you have your data processed and visualised it's time to use some human brain power to intepret the findings!

What have you learnt from the data, how does it compare with your hypothesis and what future predictions or decisions will it effect?


--- Slide 106 ---

Step 4:

Step 4:   Data Interpretation

What have you learnt from the data, how does it compare with your hypothesis and what future predictions or decisions will it effect?

Example:
We have learned that the levels of theft arrests made in Mountjoy Prison fluctuated between 2003 and 2016, with a peak in 2003 and a low in 2007. This did not fit our hypothesis. Around times of recession, theft rates increased, for example from 2007 to 2013. They also fell during times of economic wellbeing.
