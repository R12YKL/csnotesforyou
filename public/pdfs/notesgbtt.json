This raises many ethical questions\n\n\n--- Slide 4 ---\n\nA Case Study – Travelling to New York\n\n1950’s – Dublin to New York\nDeclan makes a number of phone calls to travel agents a month before he wants to travel\nA few days later he visits his selected travel agent and buys his return flight to New York Via London (€6,000 in todays money). His flight is 2 weeks later than he wanted but 1 month away was too expensive\n\n\n--- Slide 5 ---\n\nA Case Study – Travelling to New York\n\n1950’s – Dublin to New York\nDeclan uses the Travel Agent to reserve a room in hotel in Manhattan for €1,000. This involves lots of paperwork. He chose his room based on a paragraph of text with no photos.\nHe pays the Travel Agent over €4,000 by cheque and still owes the travel Agent over €3,000\nHe borrows €3,000 from is father. Declan goes to the post office and posts the second cheque to the travel agent.\n\n\n--- Slide 6 ---\n\nA Case Study – Travelling to New York\n\n1950’s – Dublin to New York\nA few days later, he phones the Travel Agent to check if the cheque had arrived.\nThe travel agent puts the tickets and hotel reservation documents in the post\nDeclan receives his tickets, etc.. 2 days before the flight.\n\n\n--- Slide 7 ---\n\nA Case Study – Travelling to New York\n\n1950’s – Dublin to New York\nDay of flight, Declan makes very expensive call to friends in New York to tell them he’s on the way.\nAt airport , he waits in several long queues where paperwork is checked and luggage dealt with\nDeclan puts paper nametags on his luggage. If they fall off or his luggage get lost, it will probably be lost forever so he keeps all valuables on him.\n\n\n--- Slide 8 ---\n\nA Case Study – Travelling to New York\n\n1950’s – Dublin to New York\nDeclan gets his flight to London and walks around Heathrow asking people where to get the New York flight. Eventually he finds the correct gate\nHe arrives in New York and waits in Immigration queue to get passport checked\nThere’s an issue with his visa but it eventually gets sorted out\n\n\n--- Slide 9 ---\n\nA Case Study – Travelling to New York\n\n1950’s – Dublin to New York\nDeclan has to ask people where to pick up his luggage and eventually gets sorted\nHe gets his currency exchanged at a desk at the airport and it is very expensive.\nHe buys something at a newsagents so he has change to make a phone call to his friends to arrange to meet them the following day\n\n\n--- Slide 10 ---\n\nA Case Study – Travelling to New York\n\n1950’s – Dublin to New York\nDeclan realises he forgot to give an important file to his boss before he left. To sort this out he makes a very expensive phone call to his boss to explain where he left the file on his desk.\nHe gets a taxi to his hotel. Due to an accident blocking the road he gets out early but can’t figure out where his hotel is. He asks a passerby but they don’t understand his accent. Eventually he finds someone who can tell him where to go and he finds his hotel.\n\n\n--- Slide 11 ---\n\nA Case Study – Travelling to New York\n\n1950’s – Dublin to New York\nDeclan’s watch has stopped because he forgot to wind it. He considers buying one of those new battery operated ones but they’re very expensive\n\n\n--- Slide 12 ---\n\nA Case Study – Travelling to New York\n\nToday – Siobhán’s Journey\nSiobhán booked her ticket the day before her flight. It was expensive as a result €600. She pays for it completely with her credit card.\nSiobhán applied for her ESTA (visa to visit America) in advance but it only took a few minutes\nSiobhán used the WWW to search for hotels in New York under $200 per night and finds 1,543 options\n\n\n--- Slide 13 ---\n\nA Case Study – Travelling to New York\n\nToday – Siobhán’s Journey\nSiobhán uses reviews from other tourists and lots of photos of the hotel rooms to chose her hotel and room. She appreciates the photos taken by other tourists of the hotel taken only last week. She doesn’t trust the hotels own photos to show the whole story.\nSiobhan uses a comparison website to find the best price for the hotel she wants to stay in and pays for it online.\nSiobhán checks in for her flight online and gets her mobile boarding pass.\n\n\n--- Slide 14 ---\n\nA Case Study – Travelling to New York\n\nToday – Siobhán’s Journey\nSiobhán emails her friends in New York with the details of her visit\nNext morning, she uses an app to book a taxi to the airport\nShe brings her bags at the automated luggage drop machine where she uses her mobile boarding pass on her phone to check her luggage in and print the luggage tag. Siobhan bought a GPS bag so she can track her luggage with her phone anywhere in the world.\n\n\n--- Slide 15 ---\n\nA Case Study – Travelling to New York\n\nToday – Siobhán’s Journey\nSiobhán is a computer programmer and notes that the metal detectors, body scanners and x-ray machines are all computer systems.\nDuring takeoff, she can’t use any electronic devices.\nThe plane has free wi-fi so Siobhan researches what the winglets on the tip of the wings are for. These are an example of how computers have changed air travel. The winglets save fuel and their design was aided by cheap computational testing instead of expensive wind tunnel testing.\n\n\n--- Slide 16 ---\n\nA Case Study – Travelling to New York\n\nToday – Siobhán’s Journey\nSiobhán is a computer programmer and notes that the metal detectors, body scanners and x-ray machines are all computer systems.\nDuring takeoff, she can’t use any electronic devices.\nThe plane has free wi-fi so Siobhan researches what the winglets on the tip of the wings are for.

More and more the internet is built into our everyday experiences. The internet is expected to play an even greater part in our day to day lives\n\n\n--- Slide 25 ---\n\nMedicine and Healthcare\n\nComputing technology has greatly improved medicine and healthcare.\nMuch of modern medicine still depends on people, which carries a risk of human error. Often a diagnosis is based on the interpretation of information by a single person – and people make mistakes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V680nMGpeEM&t=8s\n\n\n--- Slide 26 ---\n\nMedicine and Healthcare\n\nComputing is transforming medicine by assisting medical professionals to make a diagnosis.\n\n\n--- Slide 27 ---\n\nMedicine and Healthcare – Image recognition and classification algorithms\n\nImage recognition and classification algorithms are already being used to identify cancerous tumours in medical imaging.\nThis was done up to recently solely by people, but now with assistance from computers the chances of errors occurring can be greatly reduced.\n\n\n--- Slide 28 ---\n\nMedicine and Healthcare – Image recognition and classification algorithms\n\nThe computer pre-process the images and identify potentially cancerous tumours. A human expert can then pay extra attention to these images\nThe computer can also post-process images that were already checked by an expert to ensure nothing was missed.\n\n\n--- Slide 29 ---\n\nMedicine and Healthcare – Clinical Decision Support Systems\n\nIn Ireland, the GP, plays a central role in the healthcare system and is normally the 1st person seek medical advice\nSome GPs are already using computers to help them do their work better. One specific area that’s in a rapid state of change is clinical decision systems\n\n\n--- Slide 30 ---\n\nMedicine and Healthcare – Clinical Decision Support Systems\n\nA clinical decision support system provides doctors with assistance in making medical decisions.\nThe system can be knowledge based. The system uses information from medical literature and expert knowledge\nThe system can be based on artificial intelligence.\n\n\n--- Slide 31 ---\n\nMedicine and Healthcare – Clinical Decision Support Systems – An example\n\nPatient presents with a fever, headache and a rash on the stomach\nTraditionally the doctor must rely on their experience and knowledge (both of which may be biased and based on limited number of cases) to guide their diagnosis\nA Clinical Support System instantly draws upon symptoms and diagnosis from thousands of cases and factor them into the diagnosis\n\n\n--- Slide 32 ---\n\nMedicine and Healthcare – Clinical Decision Support Systems – An example\n\nOther not readily accessible information can be used with these systems e.g The system may prompt the doctor to ask if the patient travelled abroad recently as these 3 symptoms are common to a rare disease in some distant country\n The doctor may not have come across this disease before. Without the clinical support system, the doctor may not have considered this possibility\n\n\n--- Slide 33 ---\n\nMedicine and Healthcare – Genomics\n\nA field of molecular biology that focuses on genomes, a complete set of an organisms DNA\nSeveral thousand genetic diseases affect humans and are 1 of the main causes of infant deaths. (Downs Syndrome, Fragile X syndrome..) Identifying which genetic disease is affecting a critically ill child is very difficult and often time is of the essence\n\n\n--- Slide 34 ---\n\nMedicine and Healthcare – Genomics - Example\n\nThe Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine in the US reported a baby suffering from liver failure for an unknown reason. The hospital used 25 hours of supercomputer time to analyse 120 Billion DNA sequences, narrowing down the cause of the illnss to two possibilities. This allowed the doctors to save the baby’s life. Without advanced computing technology the baby would have died.\n\n\n--- Slide 35 ---\n\nMedicine and Healthcare – Genomics – Screening for genetic markers\n\nScientists have identified genetic markers that can indicate a predisposition to certain diseases, including several types of cancer.\nScreening for some inherited and other genetic diseases is now common\n\n\n--- Slide 36 ---\n\nMedicine and Healthcare – Genomics – Screening for genetic markers\n\nCystic fibrosis, and Huntingdon’s disease are caused by genetic mutations. Genetic markers for these and many other diseases  are currently being researched using rapidly developing technologies.\n\n\n--- Slide 37 ---\n\nMedicine and Healthcare – Genomics – Alteration of Genetic Code\n\nIt’s technically possible to analyse and alter genetic code of humans, even before birth, to achieve many goals such as avoid some diseases.\nTechnical, LEGAL and ETHICAL issues must be overcome for these practices to become mainstream.\n\n\n--- Slide 38 ---\n\nMedicine and Healthcare – Genomics – Alteration of Genetic Code\n\nThe ability to alter genetic code means that people could potentially chose non-life threatening attributes influenced by genetics for their children (eye colour, predisposition for baldness or weight gain etc..)\nGenetic editing of human embryos is illegal or restricted in most countries. This area is fraught with ethical concerns and require legal, governmental and societal oversight\n\n\n--- Slide 39 ---\n\nTasks -\n\nComputer Science Book pg 281 Task 4\nResearch some potential future changes in genomics that computing technology many bring about.\nComputer Science book pg 293 Task 10.\n\n\n--- Slide 40 ---\n\nEncryption and Privacy\n\nEncryption refers to the use of algorithms to securely encode a message into a ciphertext.\nThe recipients have the means to decode the ciphertext back into plaintext\nEncryption allows anyone with a computer and special software to encode messages and information\n\n\n--- Slide 41 ---\n\nEncryption and Privacy\n\nIt is becoming more common for web pages to use hypertext transfer protocol secure (https). The visitor to a website using https can be relatively sure they are communicating directly with the intended website. They can be reasonably confident that any information between their computer and the websiteis safe, even if it is intercepted by a malicious actor.\n\n\n--- Slide 42 ---\n\nEncryption and Privacy\n\nMany popular messaging and social media apps also use encryption to ensure that message sent from one user to another are not readable by anyone who intercepts them\nSimilarly, industrial and military communications are often encrypted\nMany businesses use software on their computers/devices that encrypt all stored data so that if a laptop is stolen, the data can not be accessed without the correct password\n\n\n--- Slide 43 ---\n\nEncryption and Privacy\n\nThese encryptions do not just protect the data with a password but all data is also encrypted (unreadable/scrambled). The password lets the user in but also unscrambles the data so that it makes sense\n\n\n--- Slide 44 ---\n\nEncryption and the economy\n\nEncryption is also the basis of much of the world’s economy. Online banking and many other transactions rely on some form of encryption\n\n\n--- Slide 45 ---\n\nEncryption and the economy: Currency\n\nBitcoin became a household name around 2018. It is one form of cryptocurrency.\nCryptocurrency is any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually (not in physical form) and uses cryptography to secure transactions.\n\n\n--- Slide 46 ---\n\nEncryption and the economy: Currency\n\nSome advantages of digital currencies compared to physical currency (coins, paper banknotes etc..) include instant transfer, traceability and protection from traditional theft and loss.\nBitcoin is just one of thousands of types of currency.\nCryptocurrency uses decentralized control which means no one person or bank or government can control the transactions or create new units of currency.\n\n\n--- Slide 47 ---\n\nEncryption and the economy: Currency\n\nThe adoption of digital currency has been relatively slow. It is likely that society will continue to move towards digital currencies and away from current systems largely based on fiat currencies where the value is often enforced by a centralised authority.\nA weakness of fiat currencies is that its dependent on a centralised authority such as a government and in difficult times such as war, the currency can experience wild fluctuations in value.\n\n\n--- Slide 48 ---\n\nEncryption and the economy: Currency\n\nAnother weakness of fiat currencies is they require large banking systems to facilitate safekeeping, exchange and other services. This makes the use of fiat currencies expensive in comparison to digital currencies.\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp\n\n\n--- Slide 49 ---\n\nJobs\n\nComputers have created thousands of job types and millions of individual jobs that a few decades ago, did not exist. Many of these jobs are directly concerned with computing technologies including:\nComputer programmers\nIT managers\nWeb designers\nSocial Media celebrities\n\n\n--- Slide 50 ---\n\nJobs\n\nA large number of jobs have also been indirectly created by computing. e.g. the rise in online shopping has led to a massive increase in parcel shipments creating many new jobs in warehousing and distribution\nMany jobs have been lost due to changes in technology. Jobs that require routine , repetitive and dangerous tasks such as assembly line work and working with hazardous materials have been eliminated and replaced with automated processes and and robotic solutions\n\n\n--- Slide 51 ---\n\nJobs\n\nRetail jobs have been lost due to online shopping\nTravel agents have been disrupted by the internet and e-commerce\n\n\n--- Slide 52 ---\n\nRemote Working\n\nDuring the pandemic many peoples jobs were saved because of technology. Technology allowed people to carry out their jobds remotely\nShifting to remote working provides flexibility and can preserve jobs but it highlights the importance of everyone having access to high speed broadband.\nRemote working can also revitalise rural towns that were struggling to survive pre-pandemic\nRemote working also benefits the environment as there is less commuting\n\n\n--- Slide 53 ---\n\nThe Environment\n\nComputing has many substantial direct effects on the environment\nNuclear Weapons Testing using supercomputers One of the most common uses of supercomputers is to accurately test and model the effects of nuclear weapons. Prior to supercomputers, live tests were the only viable option. Live nuclear tests, resulted in destructions of many areas of Earth; the production of tons of nuclear waste; the health of millions of people were affected by these nuclear tests and the displacement of many minorities and marginalised groups of people.\n\n\n--- Slide 54 ---\n\nThe Environment\n\nComputing has many substantial direct effects on the environment\nEnergy Consumption and reduction :Power consumption has become one of the largest issues of computing technology. Cryptocurrency mining uses more energy than the entire country of Ireland.\nComputers enable some processes to be more energy efficient through better control and analysis. E.g. modern electric cards would not be possible without the software that controls them. Electric cars produce fewer emissions and are more energy efficient than traditional cars.\n\n\n--- Slide 55 ---\n\nImage and facial recognition\n\nThere has been a rapid increase in the accuracy and proliferation of image and facial recognition in recent years\nThe ability to scan vehicle number plates is used for many purposes: controlling access to carparks; enforcing toll payments ;identifying car owners with outstanding arrest warrants.\nFacial recognition systems are now used to: scan airport passengers; provide access to mobile phones; match photos of similar people / family on social media platforms\n\n\n--- Slide 56 ---\n\nImage and facial recognition\n\nIn China, it is now common to pay for goods just by looking at the camera at the til.\nImage recognition and classification are used to detect skin cancers and scan people’s retinas (for biometric security/identification as well as disease\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8BzK_LU0E\n\n\n--- Slide 57 ---\n\nEducation – Online Learning\n\nThere are vast quantities of online courses, instructional videos and distance and blended learning where students can study almost any subjects, at university level and lower, without leaving the comfort of their own home.\nIt is common to submit homework online. Many top universities such as Havard, MIT and Standford deliver Massive Online Open Courses (MOOC) with thousands of students . They are mainly free and available worldwide\n\n\n--- Slide 58 ---\n\nLinguistics and Communication\n\nSpeech Interpretation The main barrier to this was a lack of algorithms that could effectively, quickly and accurately interpret human speech. Human speech is extremely vague and confusing. -  \t- There are many different ways to say the same thing.\nWords that sound exactly the same, can have different meanings e.g rain, reign, reins, reindeer; two, to, too,\n\n\n--- Slide 59 ---\n\nLinguistics and Communication\n\nSpeech Interpretation As humans we are very good at interpreting the meanings but it is extremely difficult to write programs to correctly interpret speech. Recently, algorithms have been developed, and computers can now interpret speech quite accurately\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6altVgTOf9s\n\n\n--- Slide 60 ---\n\nLinguistics and Communication\n\nAutomatic Translation\nOne way that computing has affected linguistics is by automatically translating from one language to another. It is now possible to have software on your phone that can translate  between dozens of natural languages in real time. This was only in its infancy a few years ago but it has opened up new travel and international business opportunities for millions of people.\n\n\n--- Slide 61 ---\n\nArt & Entertainment\n\nArt & entertainment has been radically impacted by computer technology.\nAnimated feature films are now entirely dependent on cutting edge technology to produce their content.  Animated films are now COMPLETELY generated by computers. Some of the scenes are so complex that high performance computing software is required to render the images. These films use tens of thousands of computer processors and hundreds of millions of CPU hours. If only a single computer was available, it would take tens of thousands of years to make a single film.\n\n\n--- Slide 62 ---\n\nDeveloping Societies, human rights and Equality\n\nOne of the greatest promises of computing technology lies in the help it may be able to give developing world. Technology may be able to locate resources such as drinking water, healthcare and education\nDigital Divide Computing technology may lead to greater inequality by increasing the gap between those that have easy and affordable access to computers and the internet and those who do not.\nThe internet is reshaping our definition of human  rights. Should access to the internet be a human right??\n\n\n--- Slide 63 ---\n\nDeveloping Societies, human rights and Equality\n\nThe internet is reshaping our definition of human  rights. Should access to the internet be a human right?? Access to the internet can: Affect freedom of speech; enable social mobility; provide the ability to earn an income; facilitate learning about potentially life-threatening matters; provide free access to medical information.\n\n\n--- Slide 64 ---\n\nDeveloping Societies, human rights and Equality\n\nInternet access depends on socio-economic status, geographical location, political environment and the local laws.\nIn 1999, only 0.04% of the world had internet access. In 2014 it had increased to 40% and by 2020 it was almost 60%\nBut the ability to access the internet is not the same from country to country\n\n\n--- Slide 65 ---\n\nMedia and social media\n\nThe internet and social media can be used to influence people. Fake news can spread easily and quickly and can affect decisions such as :\nSelecting which product to chose\nMaking important health decisions\nDetermining who to vote for in political elections.\n\n\n--- Slide 66 ---\n\nMedia and social media\n\nDeep fakes are material that artificial intelligence produces to provide fraudulent but credible looking photos, audio clips and video clips. Deep fakes proliferate the internet and have the capacity to misinform and mislead millions.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLoI9hAX9dw\n\n\n--- Slide 67 ---\n\nSome questions to answer\n\nPg 293 Q15 – How might people in the developing world be empowered by computing technology\n\nPg 293 Q18 Find one positive and one negative effect computing technology can have on democratic elections.\n\nPg 293 Q20 What could the use of cyber warfare involve, if used in future conflicts.\n\n\n--- Slide 68 ---\n\nArtificial Intelligence / Machine Learning\n\nArtificial Intelligence refers to using computer systems to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence\nMachine Learning gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed\nWhat is Artificial Intelligence\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOP2eJWehwo&list=PLIP_AClgjRDgDqmMD5qRhrqAzVLUaeixm&index=2\n\n\n--- Slide 69 ---\n\nMachine Learning\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETfWKZIu-sk\nCheatsheet -> https://bit.ly/32qdLPH\n\n\n===== 4  Embedded Systems.pptx =====\n\n\n--- Slide 1 ---\n\nEmbedded Systems\n\nUsing the BBC Microbit\n\n\n--- Slide 2 ---\n\nWhat is an Embedded System\n\n\n--- Slide 3 ---\n\nExamples of Embedded System\n\nExamples of embedded systems include:\ncentral heating systems\nengine management systems in vehicles\ndomestic appliances, such as dishwashers, TVs and digital phones\ndigital watches\nelectronic calculators\nGPS systems\nfitness trackers\n\n\n--- Slide 4 ---\n\nProgramming the micro:bit\n\n\n--- Slide 5 ---\n\nWhat is a micro:bit\n\nBattery pack\n\nMicro-USB cable\n\nmicro:bit\n\n\n--- Slide 6 ---\n\nWhat is a micro:bit (front)\n\n1 – A and B buttons\n2 – LED display and light sensor\n3 – Pins GBIO\n4 – Pin 3 volt power\n5 – Pin Ground\n6 – Touch logo\n7 – Microphone LED\n\n\n--- Slide 7 ---\n\nWhat is a micro:bit (back)\n\n1 – Radio and Bluetooth antenna\n2 – Processor & Temperature Sensor\n3 – Compass\n4 – Accelerometer\n5 – Pins\n6 – Micro USB socket\n9 – Battery Socket\n10 – USB Interface chip\n11 – Speaker\n12 – Microphone\n13 – Red power LED\n14 – Yellow USB LED\n15 – Reset & Power button\n\n\n--- Slide 8 ---\n\nMicrobit Sensors\n\nAccelerometer – a motion sensor that measures movement. The accelerometer in your BBC micro:bit detects when you tilt it left to right, backwards and forwards and up and down.\nTemperature Sensor - An input device that measures temperature. The temperature sensor is inside the processor which can give you an approximation of the air temperature.\nLight Sensor - An input device that measures light levels. Your micro:bit uses the LEDs to sense the levels of light.\n\n\n--- Slide 9 ---\n\nMicrobit Sensors\n\nCompass – The compass is an input sensor that detects magnetic fields. The micro:bit has an inbuilt compass that can detect the direction in which it is facing.\nTouch Logo - The touch logo uses capacitive touch, sensing tiny changes in electrical fields to know when your finger is pressing it - just like your phone or tablet screen.\nMicrophone - The micro:bit has a built-in microphone. You can use it as a simple input - make your micro:bit turn the lights on when you clap. It can measure the amount of sound\n\n\n--- Slide 10 ---\n\nMicrobit Sensors\n\nRadio - Radio is a way of sending and receiving messages and BBC micro:bits can use radio waves to communicate with each other.\nPins - On the bottom edge of the micro:bit there are 25 gold strips, called pins. These pins allow you create circuits or connect external things like buzzers and motors\nButtons - Buttons are a very common input device. Your micro:bit has two buttons you can program, and a reset button\n\n\n--- Slide 11 ---\n\nMicrosoft MakeCode\n\nGo to https://makecode.microbit.org and click on New Project\n\n\n--- Slide 12 ---\n\nMicrosoft MakeCode Editor\n\nSimulator\n\nToolbox\n\nWorkspace\n\n\n--- Slide 13 ---\n\nAlgorithms\n\nAn algorithm is a sequence of instructions or a set of rules to get something done.\n\nComputer scientists strive for algorithms which solve problems in the most-effective and efficient ways – getting the most-accurate results, in the quickest time, with the fewest resources (memory or time).\n\nImage Source: codemonkey.com\n\n\n--- Slide 14 ---\n\nVariables\n\nA variable is a place where you can store and retrieve data.\n\nHere’s how to define a variable in the Block Editor:\n1. From the Variables Toolbox category select ‘Make\na Variable’ and give your variable a name.\n2. Drag the                                       and place it inside the\non start bracket.\n\n> What is a variable?\n\n\n--- Slide 15 ---\n\nVariables (contd)\n\nComplete the following blocks of code and initialise each variable to the value of 0 at the start of the programme.\n\n\n--- Slide 16 ---\n\nVariables (contd)\n\n> We need to code to update the values at each round of the game.\n\nEach time the scorekeeper presses button A to record a win for Player A, we want to add 1 to the current value of the variable PlayerAWins.\n\nWe want the same to happen when button B is pressed and also for when button A and B are pressed at the same time.\n\n\n--- Slide 17 ---\n\nWe can code our programme to display an ‘A’, ‘B’ or ‘T’ using the show leds block.\nThis will give the user visual feedback acknowledging that the user pressed a button.\nNotice that we added a clear screen block after showing ‘A’, ‘B’, or ‘T’.\n\nBasic Toolbox Category\n\n\n--- Slide 18 ---\n\nDrag out the on shake event handler block from the Input Toolbox category to trigger this event.\nAdd the show string show number pause show leds and clear screen blocks from the Basic Toolbox category and insert them into the on shake bracket as shown.\nIn the Variables Toolbox category drag out the curved variable name blocks and insert them in the corresponding show number blocks to activate them.\n\nDisplay Final Variable Values\n\n\n--- Slide 19 ---\n\nAccelerometer\n\nThe micro:bit contains an accelerometer sensor that is able to measure forces applied to the board. On earth, we are subject to the gravity force which pulls us to the ground!\nWhen the micro:bit is flat on a table, with the screen pointing up, the gravity force is aligned with the Z axis of the micro:bit.\nIf you tilt it up and down, the force will align with the Y axis – this is how we can detect tilting. If the force along Y grows, the micro:bit is tilting more and more vertically.\n\n\n--- Slide 20 ---\n\nConditionals\n\nA condition is criteria that the user must meet for a certain function to be carried out.\n\n> What is a condition?\n\nWe can add a condition to make code function in certain ways:\n\nA calculator waits for the user in input numbers and a function, before outputting a result\nA game waits for the user to press a button at the right time before outputting their score\nA quiz waits for the user to choose the correct option, and if they are wrong the quiz will tell the user\n\n> Why use a condition?\n\n\n--- Slide 21 ---\n\nConditionals (Contd)\n\nThe code inside the if block only runs when the condition block is true. You can compare variables to values or variables to variables, for a true condition.\n\nIf you want some other code to run when the opposite condition is true, you put it in an additional block area called else.\n\n\n--- Slide 22 ---\n\nBlock Code\n\nAdd an on shake block from the Input Toolbox category to run code when you shake the micro:bit\nCreate a variable called ‘hand’ and place the set hand to block in the shake event.\nAdd a pick random block from the Math Toolbox category to pick a random number from 1 to 3 and store it in the variable named ‘hand’.\n\n> Create this programme\n\n\n--- Slide 23 ---\n\nBlock Code\n\nPlace an if block form the Logic Toolbox category under the pick random and check whether ‘hand’ is equal to 1.\n\nAdd a show leds block from the Basic Toolbox category that shows a picture of a piece of paper.

This is represented by the pair of arrows (from memory to CPU and back)\nInput and Output devices that allow data to come into the computer and results to be sent out.\nAll the components work together to allow processing of the data and system control.\n\n\n--- Slide 9 ---\n\nVon Nuemann Architecture\n\n\n--- Slide 10 ---\n\nVon Neumann Architecture  - CPU\n\nThe Control unit (CU) directs/controls the operation of the CPU.\nThe control unit is responsible for controlling the memory, processor and input-output devices.\nIt contains the CIR (Current Instruction Register) and PC (Program Counter) registers.\nThe CIR (register) contains the current instruction carried out by the processor.\nThe PC contains the location of the next instruction to be executed.\nThe control unit reads the instructions from the memory, decodes it and sends control signals to the memory and input-output devices.\n\n\n--- Slide 11 ---\n\nVon Neumann Architecture\u000b - CPU\n\nArithmetic logic unit (ALU)\nThe ALU has two main functions:\nThe ALU is responsible for arithmetic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. and logic operations such as AND, OR, NOT, etc.\nThe accumulator register (ACC) stores the results of arithmetic and logical operations performed by a processor.\n\n\n--- Slide 12 ---\n\nVon Neumann Architecture\u000b - CPU\n\nRegisters\nRegister memory is very expensive and the fastest. Registers have a small capacity compared to other types of memory e.g. RAM or ROM\nDifferent processors have different numbers of registers for different purposes. Most have some, or all, of the following:\nprogram counter (PC)\nmemory address register (MAR)\nmemory data register (MDR)\ncurrent instruction register (CIR)\naccumulator (ACC)\n\n\n--- Slide 13 ---\n\nVon Neumann Architecture\u000b - CPU\n\nRegisters\nRegisters -> The Program Counter\nContains the memory location of the next instruction to be executed\nCIR (Current Instruction Register) the current instruction being decoded\nAccumulator (ACC) - the results of calculations\n\n\n--- Slide 14 ---\n\nVon Neumann Architecture - CPU\n\nRegisters -> Memory Data Registers\nHold data temporarily. This data is operated on by the CPU. This data originally came from memory across the bus and the results will typically be returned to memory.\nRegisters -> Memory Address Registers\nStore memory addresses. This is a value that indicates a specific location in memory. This could be the location in memory of data to be operated on, or results to be sent to memory over the bus.\n\n\n--- Slide 15 ---\n\nVon Nuemann Architure – Input & Output Devices\n\nAn input device, like a keyboard or mouse, converts the signals sent by humans to a form that can be understood by the computer.\nOutput devices such as printers, monitors, etc. convert the information from the computer into a form that is understandable by humans.\n\n\n--- Slide 16 ---\n\nVon Neumann Architecture – \u000bFetch –Decode- Execute Cycle\n\nTo carry out the instructions, the processor fetches the data and instructions from the memory and stores it in suitable registers.\nThese instructions are decoded and then executed.\n\n\n--- Slide 17 ---\n\nThe Fetch – Execute Cycle\n\n\n--- Slide 18 ---\n\nThe fetch-decode-execute cycle: Fetch\n\nThe program counter contains the location of the instruction that is to be executed next. This address is copied to the MAR.\nThe instruction is fetched from the memory and copied to the MDR first.\nThen, contents of the MDR are copied to the CIR (Current Instruction Register).\nThe value in a program counter is incremented by 1 and, hence, the instruction in the next memory location is processed.\n\n\n--- Slide 19 ---\n\nThe fetch-decode-execute cycle: Decode and execute\n\nDecode\nThe instructions in the CIR are decoded so that it can be executed.\nExecute\nThe processor sends appropriate control signals to the memory unit and input-output devices in the computer system, according to the decoded instruction.\n\n\n--- Slide 20 ---\n\nRegisters involved in the Fetch –Decode – Execute Cycle\n\n\n--- Slide 21 ---\n\nVon Neumann Architecture -> The Bus\n\nA bus is a communication pathway that allows data and instructions to travel between different components in a computer. Think of it as a collection of wires that allow data and instructions to move from memory to the CPU and back.\nThere are many buses on the motherboard. The speed of a bus is measured in megahertz (MHz). The faster the bus, the faster data is communicated. The speed of the motherboard is defined by the bus speed.\nBuses are limited by their width in bits. They are usually 8, 16 or 32-bits wide. This tells us how many bits can be sent by the bus at any one time, eg a 32-bit bus can send 32 bits at once.\n\n\n--- Slide 22 ---\n\nvon Neumann architecture The Buses\n\n22\n\n\n--- Slide 23 ---\n\nBuses\n\n23\n\n\n--- Slide 24 ---\n\nLet’s review some concepts\n\nBuses\nThe connection between the processor, memory, and input-output devices.\n\nProcessor\nThe processor contains ALU (Arithmetic and Logic unit) and Control Unit (CU).\n\nCIR (Current Instruction register)\nThe CIR contains the current instruction carried out by the processor\n\nPC (Program Counter)\nThe PC contains the location of the instruction that is to be executed next.\n\nAccumulator\nAccumulator (ACC) is the register that stores the results of arithmetic and logical operations performed by the processor.\n\n\n--- Slide 25 ---\n\nVon Neumann Architecture - Memory\n\nEarly computers could not store programs internally. Programs had to be stored externally on punch cards, magnetic tapes or floppy disks.\nModern computers store programs internally in memory.\n\n\n--- Slide 26 ---\n\nPrimary Memory - RAM\n\nRAM is PRIMARY Memory\nRandom Access Memory (RAM) is known as volatile memory. If the computer loses power, the data in RAM is lost. RAM is fast compared to other memory that is not volatile.\nRAM holds the data and instructions of the program that is currently being executed by the CPU.\nRAM is not where files are stored for long-term use, e.g photos on your computer. They are stored in secondary memory.\n\n\n--- Slide 27 ---\n\nPrimary Memory - ROM\n\nROM read only memory is non-volatile. Its contents remain stored whether the computer is powered on or not. A typical use of ROM is to store the computer’s BIOS (Basic input/output system) which is the software responsible for booting up the system. When computer is turned on, BIOS performs the necessary checks and then hands control over to the operating system\n\n\n--- Slide 28 ---\n\nMemory\n\nMemory used to store information for immediate use by the CPU is also referred to as main memory or primary storage. RAM and ROM are both types of primary storage\nHow computer memory works\nBBC Bitesize Revision - CPU & Memory\n\n\n--- Slide 29 ---\n\nSystem Archtecture - CPU\n\nCache\nCache is a small amount of high-speed random access memory (RAM) built directly within the processor. It is used to temporarily hold data and instructions that the processor is likely to reuse. This allows for faster processing, as the processor does not have to wait for the data and instructions to be fetched from the RAM.\n\n\n--- Slide 30 ---\n\nFactors Determining the Speed of the CPU\n\nEven though today's processors are tremendously fast, their performance can be affected by a number of factors including:\n\nclock speed\nNumber of cores\n- Cache size\n- RAM\n\n\n--- Slide 31 ---\n\nFactors Determining the Speed of the CPU\n\nNumber of cores. A processing unit within a CPU is known as a core. Each core is capable of fetching, decoding and executing its own instructions. The more cores a CPU has, the greater the number of instructions it can process in a given space of time.\n\n\n--- Slide 32 ---\n\nFactors Determining the Speed of the CPU\n\nClock speed. Clock speed is the number of pulses the CPU’s clock generates per second. It is measured in hertz. The more pulses per second, the more fetch-decode-execute cycles that can be performed and the more instructions that are processed in a given space of time.\n\n\n--- Slide 33 ---\n\nFactors Determining the Speed of the CPU\n\nCache. A cache is a fast, relatively small capacity set of locations that is built directly within the processor. Cache is used to store the instructions and data that the processor is most likely to need and reuse. The bigger its cache, the less time a processor has to wait for instructions to be fetched. \n\n\n--- Slide 34 ---\n\nFactors Determining the Speed of the CPU\n\nRAM. This is the short-term memory of the computer that holds all of the programs and data currently being ran by the computer. Having more memory means that the data and instructions that need to be processed will not have to be fetched from secondary storage (which is a much slower process).\nTemperature. If CPU gets too hot performance will decrease.\n\n\n--- Slide 35 ---\n\nFactors affecting the speed of a CPU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS1rEJZKr4U\n\n\n--- Slide 36 ---\n\nVon Neumann Architecture -> Secondary Storage\n\nSecondary devices are used to store data persistently.  They store information regardless of whether the computer is turned on or not. It is non-volatile memory, unlike RAM that is volatile.\n\n\n--- Slide 37 ---\n\nDifferences between Primary and Secondary storage\n\nPrimary storage stores information for immediate use by the CPU while secondary storage stores data that can be used at any time.\nPrimary storage stores data temporarily (apart from ROM), whereas secondary storage stores data persistently\nPrimary storage is faster than secondary storage\n\n\n--- Slide 38 ---\n\nDifferences between Primary and Secondary storage\n\nPrimary storage is more expensive than secondary storage per unit, such as megabyte(MB) or gigabyte (GB).\nPrimary storage is smaller ( less capacity)\n\n\n--- Slide 39 ---\n\nSecondary storage\n\nA typical modern personal computer can store up to several terabytes (TB). RAM is in the order of several or several dozen gigabytes (GB)\nSecondary storage are normally hard drives. There are 2 types of hard drives magnetic and solid state disk (SSD). Magnetic hard drives are more common.\nMagnetic hard disks contain a magnetic platter that turns at a very high speed. A head moves across the spinning platter and reads information\n\n\n--- Slide 40 ---\n\nSecondary storage\n\nSolid State Disks (SSD) is becoming more widespread. These are faster and more durable than magnetic disks because they have no moving parts. Most SSD are based on flash memory. Flash memory is what USB memory stick are based on.\nSSD are expensive but the price is falling\n\n\n--- Slide 41 ---\n\n\n--- Slide 42 ---\n\nSpeed & Cost of Memory\n\n\n--- Slide 43 ---\n\nThe closer a memory type is to the CPU, the quicker the CPU can access the instructions and execute them. However, the closer it is to the CPU the smaller and more expensive it is. Each type of memory is limited by their speed, size, cost and position in relation to the CPU.\n\nMemory Overview\n\n\n--- Slide 44 ---\n\nThe Motherboard\n\nBBC Bitesize Revision Motherboard\nThe motherboard is a circuit board that devices are physically mounted on.\nIt connects the CPU to the memory and all the other hardware. The CPU sits on the motherboard\nMotherboard’s typically include: CPU, main memory, hard drive and many other components such as I/O devices.\nWhen you plug in a USB device into a computer, you are physically connecting to the mother board\n\n\n--- Slide 45 ---\n\nOperating Systems\n\nAn operating system (or 'OS') controls the general operation of a computer, and provides an easy way for us to interact with computers and run applications.\n\nThe OS runs runs all the time in the background\nEvery computer has an OS. They could not run without it.\n\n\n--- Slide 46 ---\n\nOperating Systems\n\nThere are a few common operating systems available:\nMac OS X - operating system for Macs\nLinux, Ubuntu, Unix  – based on Unix\nWindows\nAndroid (based on Linux)\nApple iOS\n\n\n--- Slide 47 ---\n\nFunctions of the Operating Systems\n\nThe operating system performs several key functions:\ninterface - provides a user interface so it is easy to interact with the computer, known as “user interface”\nmanages the CPU - runs applications and executes and cancels processes\nmulti-tasks - allows multiple applications to run at the same time\nManages memory - transfers programs into and out of memory, allocates free space between programs, and keeps track of memory usage\n\n\n--- Slide 48 ---\n\nFunctions of the Operating Systems\n\nThe operating system performs several key functions:\n5. \tManages peripherals - opens, closes and writes to peripheral devices such as storage attached to the computer\n6.\t organises - creates a file system to organise files and directories and manages it\n7. \tsecurity - provides security through user accounts and passwords\n8.\tutilities - provides tools for managing and organising hardware\n\n\n--- Slide 49 ---\n\nOperating Systems Functions – User Interface\n\nUser interface\nA user interface is the means by which the user provides input to a computer and the computer conveys output to the user. Specifically, it is the point of interaction between a user and a computer through the use of input / output devices.\nThe UI is either graphical or text-based.\nGraphical user interface (GUI)\nThe OS on most computers and smartphones provides an environment with tiles, icons and/or menus. This type of interface is called the graphical user interface (GUI) because the user interacts with images through a mouse, keyboard or touchscreen.\n\n\n--- Slide 50 ---\n\nOperating Systems – User Interface\n\nCommand line interface (CLI)\nAn OS also provides a method of interaction that is non-graphical, called the command line interface (CLI). This is a text-only service with feedback from the OS appearing in text. Using a CLI requires knowledge of the commands available on a particular machine.\nAdvantages of using the command line include:\na faster way to get tasks done\nit is more flexible than a GUI\nit uses less memory\nSome games, such as Minecraft, also make use of a command line tool which allows the user to bypass the main interface and alter the game’s mechanics or environment.\n\n\n--- Slide 51 ---\n\nOperating Systems – User Interface\n\n\n--- Slide 52 ---\n\n2023 LC Higher Level Q4",

We will note the remainders in order.\n\nVideo on converting decimal to binary\n\n\n--- Slide 21 ---\n\nPractice time – \u000bConvert the following decimal numbers to binary\n\n67\n92\n110\n59\n\n\n--- Slide 22 ---\n\nBinary Addition\n\n\n--- Slide 23 ---\n\nBinary Addition\n\nVideo binary Addition\n\n\n--- Slide 24 ---\n\nPractice time – \u000bAdd the following binary numbers\n\n1101 + 1010\n1110001 + 10001\n11010 + 110011\n\n\n--- Slide 25 ---\n\nLeaving Cert Questions\n\n\n--- Slide 26 ---\n\nOverflow Errors –\n\nSometimes, during binary arithmetic you will get a result that requires MORE bits than the CPU is expecting – this is called OVERFLOW.\nE.g. the 8 bit calculation 11111111 + 00000001 gives the 9-bit answer 100000000. Computers will see the 1 as an overflow error and just output 00000000 as the result, which is nonsense.\n\n\n--- Slide 27 ---\n\nOverflow Errors –\n\nComputers usually deal with these extra bits by storing them elsewhere. Overflow flags are used to show an overflow error has occurred\nOverflow errors lead to a loss of data and a loss of accuracy in your answer. It can also cause software to crash if it doesn’t have a way of dealing with the extra bit.\n\n\n--- Slide 28 ---\n\nBinary Shift –\n\nA binary shift moves every bit in a binary number to the left or right a certain number of places\nGaps at the beginning or end are filled in with 0s\nThe direction of the binary shift indicates whether it multiplies or divides the binary number.\n\n\n--- Slide 29 ---\n\nBinary Shift –\n\n\n--- Slide 30 ---\n\nExample of Binary Shifts –\n\n\n--- Slide 31 ---\n\nExample of Binary Shifts –\n\n\n--- Slide 32 ---\n\nHexadecimal code\n\nHexadecimal code or “Hex” are base 16 numbers\nWe use 0-9 for the 1st 10 digits and then A-F as the symbols for the other 6. All hexadecimal numbers are made of a combination of these digits.\n\n\n--- Slide 33 ---\n\nHexadecimal code\n\nHexadecimal or base 16 uses 16 different digits\nA single hex character can represent any decimal number from 0 – 15\nTo represent 0 – 15 in binary requires 4 bits (nibble), so each hex character equates to a 4 bits in binary\nProgrammers prefer hex when coding\n\tbecause – its simpler to remember large\n\tnumbers in hex (they’re shorter)\n\t- It’s easier to convert between binary\n\tand hex than binary and decimal.\n\n\n--- Slide 34 ---\n\nConverting from Hexadecimal to Decimal code\n\n\n--- Slide 35 ---\n\nConverting from Decimal to Hexadecimal\n\nSimilar to method for converting decimal to binary.\nStep 1: Divide the given decimal number by 16 and note down the remainder.\nStep 2: Now, divide the obtained quotient by 16, and note the remainder again.\nStep 3: Repeat the above steps until you get 0 as the quotient.\nStep 4: Now, write the remainders in such a way that the last remainder is written first, followed by the rest in the reverse order.\n\n\n--- Slide 36 ---\n\nConverting from Decimal to Hexadecimal\n\n\n--- Slide 37 ---\n\nConverting from Hex to binary\n\nHex is very easy to convert to binary.\nWrite down the hex number and represent each hex digit by its binary equivalent number from the table above.\nUse 4 digits and add insignificant leading zeros if the binary number has less than 4 digits. E.g. Write 102 (2 decimal) as 00102.\nThen concatenate or string all the digits together.\nDiscard any leading zeros at the left of the binary number.\n\n\n--- Slide 38 ---\n\nConverting from binary to hex\n\nStart from the least significant bit (LSB) at the right of the binary number and divide it up into groups of 4 bits.\nConvert each group of 4 bits to its equivalent hex value.\nConcatenate the results together, giving the total hex number.\n\n\n--- Slide 39 ---\n\nLeaving Cert Questions\n\n\n--- Slide 40 ---\n\nMore Practice Questions\n\n\n--- Slide 41 ---\n\nMore Practice Questions\n\n\n--- Slide 42 ---\n\nMore Practice Questions\n\n\n--- Slide 43 ---\n\nMore Practice Questions\n\n\n--- Slide 44 ---\n\nMore Practice Questions",

In the same way, analogue signals can vary in frequency, amplitude, or both. FM (Frequency Modulated) and AM (Amplitude Modulated) are two types of radio signals. The diagram shows a typical oscilloscope trace of an analogue signal.\n\n\n--- Slide 5 ---\n\nBinary Code and electrical signals\n\nDigital signals\nDigital signals are a series of pulses consisting of two states: ON (1) or OFF (0). There are no values in between. DAB (Digital Audio Broadcast) radio is transmitted as digital signals. The diagram shows a typical oscilloscope trace of a digital signal.\n\n\n--- Slide 6 ---\n\nAnalogue and Digital input/output on Microbits\n\nExample of Analogue sensors on the microbit are\nLight Sensor\nSound Sensor\nExample of Digital input on the microbit are\nButton A, Button B\n\nDigital vs Analogue sensors on microbit\n\n\n--- Slide 7 ---\n\nElectricity and electrons\n\nElectricity\nElectricity is a form of energy arising from the movements of electrons.\nElectrons are negatively charged particles found in every atom.\nThe CPU, memory, bus and all other components are all electronic devices.\nThey work by controlling the flow of electrons through the device.\n\n\n--- Slide 8 ---\n\nElectric Current\n\nCurrent\nElectric current is the flow of electrons from one place to another. The greater the rate of electron flow, the greater the current there is.\n\n\n--- Slide 9 ---\n\nVoltage\n\nVoltage\nAn electron will not move without voltage. Voltage is electrical force that causes electrons to flow.\nVoltage is the measure of the difference in electrical energy between two parts of a circuit. The bigger the difference in energy, the bigger the voltage.\n\n\n--- Slide 10 ---\n\nVoltage\nIn this circuit a voltage exists between each end of the battery. The electrons will flow along the connecting wire, lighting up the bulb i.e. a current flows through the circuit.\nThe current can only flow if there is a complete circuit (no break) from the battery through the wires and back to the battery again\n\n\n--- Slide 11 ---\n\nResistance\n\nResistance\nIs a measure of how much a material resists (or obstructs) the flow of electrons (current).\nDifferent materials have different resistances to the flow of electrons.\nCopper (an electrical conductor) has very low resistance and glass (an electrical insulator) has very high resistance. Gold is an excellent conductor as it has extremely low resistance.\n\n\n--- Slide 12 ---\n\nBasic electronic devices - Resistor\n\nResistors\nA resistor is a device that reduces current flow\nA kettle is like a big resistor. Its difficult for the electricity to flow through the kettle’s element. This creates heat that causes the water to boil.\nResistors have different values. Many resistors have colour bands on them that indicate their resistance value.\n\n\n--- Slide 13 ---\n\nBasic electronic devices - Resistor\n\nResistors\nA kettle is like a big resistor.

Many resistors have colour bands on them that indicate their resistance value.\n\n\n--- Slide 14 ---\n\nBasic electronic devices - Transistor\n\nTransistor\nTransistors are tiny electronic switches\nTransistor is an electronic switch within a circuit that allows a small current change to “switch” on or off a larger current\n\n\n--- Slide 15 ---\n\nBasic electronic devices - Capacitor\n\nA capacitor stores electrical energy in the form of electrical charge. Unlike batteries, capacitors do not store electrical energy for long periods of time.\nCapacitors are often used in volatile memory (RAM)\n\n\n--- Slide 16 ---\n\nBasic electronic devices - Capacitor\n\nYou can see a capacitor in action when you turn off certain electronic devices. When you press the power off button, the light that tells you the system is on, stays on for a few seconds, but then dims before going out. This is the capacitor discharging.\n\n\n--- Slide 17 ---\n\nBasic electronic devices - Capacitor\n\nCapacitors also found in touchscreens. When you touch the screen, it changes the amount of charge at that point because your skin is a weak electrical conductor. The change in charge is very small but enough to be detected by the device\nCapacitors are often used in series with resistors to achieve a time delay. The time it takes for the capacitor to become charged is related to the size of the capacitor and the value of the regulating resistor.\n\n\n--- Slide 18 ---\n\nThe CPU and logic gates\n\nBinary code is represented by electrical signals in the computer.\nDifferent devices (resistors, capacitors, transistors etc..) manipulate the flow of these signals in different ways\nIn the CPU, the TRANSISTOR is responsible for manipulating the binary code (strings of 0s and 1s)\nThe transistor acts as a switch. If the transistor is switched to “on” electrical current can flow, represented by 1.\nIf the switch is “off”, the electrical flow stops and is represented by 0.\n\n\n--- Slide 19 ---\n\nThe CPU and logic gates\n\nMany of the instructions that a CPU must carry out are based on Boolean operators, such as and, or , not\nTransistors can be arranged in different ways to carry out Boolean (logic) operations on data. These arrangements of transistors into circuits are known as Logic Gates\nLogic gates allow the CPU to carry out Boolean operations on binary code, by controlling the flow of electricity, represented by 1s and 0s.\n\n\n--- Slide 20 ---\n\nThe CPU and logic gates\n\nA CPU is mainly made up of lots of combinations of logic gates, with each type of gate consisting of a particular circuit of transistors. There are billions of transistors in the CPU.\n\n\n--- Slide 21 ---\n\nLogic Gates –> and gate\n\nThis is a diagram of an and gate, which can be constructed from a few transistors.\nAn and gate, has 2 inputs -> A & B, and one output, Y.\nThe table is called a truth table.

Wing defined computational thinking as “the thought processes involved in formulating problems and their solutions so that the solutions are represented in a form that can be effectively carried out by an information processing agent”\n\n\n--- Slide 3 ---\n\nComputational Thinking\n\nComputational thinking involves four key techniques or “pillars”:\nPattern Matching – identifying patterns and recognizing when two patterns are similar\nAbstraction – ignoring irrelevant details and reducing a problem to its essential features\nDecomposition – Breaking a complex problem down into smaller and more simpler tasks and then solving each one individually\nAlgorithms – using a sequence of steps to solved a problem\n\n\n--- Slide 4 ---\n\nComputational Thinking\n\nA complex problem is one that, at first glance, we don't know how to solve easily.\nComputational thinking involves taking that complex problem and breaking it down into a series of small, more manageable problems (decomposition). Each of these smaller problems can then be looked at individually, considering how similar problems have been solved previously (pattern recognition) and focusing only on the important details, while ignoring irrelevant information (abstraction). Next, simple steps or rules to solve each of the smaller problems can be designed (algorithms).\nFinally, the algorithms are used to program a computer to help solve the complex problem in the best way\n\n\n--- Slide 5 ---\n\nDecomposition\n\nDecomposition is breaking a complex problem down into smaller and more simpler tasks and then solving each one individually.\nIt is a way of thinking about artefacts in terms of their component parts.\n\n\n--- Slide 6 ---\n\nDecomposition\n\nFor example, making breakfast can be broken down, or decomposed, into separate activities such as make toast; make tea; boil egg; etc.  Each of these, in turn, might also be broken down into a set of steps.\nConsider developing a game: different people can design and create the different levels independently, provided that key aspects are agreed in advance. A simple arcade level might also be decomposed into several parts, such as the life-like motion of a character, scrolling the background and setting the rules about how characters interact.\n\n\n--- Slide 7 ---\n\nDecomposition (Exam Question Ordinary)\n\n\n--- Slide 8 ---\n\nDecomposition (Exam Question Ordinary)\n\n\n--- Slide 9 ---\n\nPattern Matching\n\nidentifying patterns, similarities and connections, and exploiting those features. It is a way of quickly solving new problems based on previous solutions to problems.\nAsking questions such as “Is this similar to a problem I’ve already solved?” and “How is it different?” are important here, as is the process of recognising patterns both in the data being used and the processes/strategies being used.  Algorithms that solve some specific problems can be adapted to solve a whole class of similar problems..\n\n\n--- Slide 10 ---\n\nPattern Matching (Example)\n\nA pupil uses a floor turtle to draw a series of shapes, such as a square and a triangle.  The pupil writes a computer program to draw the two shapes.  They then want to draw an octagon and a 10-sided shape.  From the work with the square and triangle, they spot that there is a relationship between the number of sides in the shape and the angles involved.  They can then write an algorithm that expresses this relationship and use it to draw any regular polygon.\n\n\n--- Slide 11 ---\n\nPattern Matching (Exam Question Higher)\n\n\n--- Slide 12 ---\n\nPattern Matching (Exam Question Higher)\n\n\n--- Slide 13 ---\n\nPattern Matching (Exam Question Higher)\n\n\n--- Slide 14 ---\n\nPattern Matching (Exam Question Higher)\n\n\n--- Slide 15 ---\n\nVideo for solution to previous question\n\n\n--- Slide 16 ---\n\nPattern Matching (Other Example)\n\n\n--- Slide 17 ---\n\nPattern Matching (Other Example)\n\n\n--- Slide 18 ---\n\nPattern Matching (Exam Question Higher)\n\n\n--- Slide 19 ---\n\nAbstraction\n\nAbstraction – ignoring irrelevant details and reducing a problem to its essential features\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-7Hy-PF2Q\n\n\n--- Slide 20 ---\n\nAbstraction\n\nAbstraction is the process of making an artefact more understandable through reducing the unnecessary detail. A classic example is the London Underground map. London is a highly complex system. The London Underground map is a highly refined abstraction with just sufficient information for the traveller to navigate the underground network without the unnecessary burden of information such as distance and exact geographic position. It is a representation that contains precisely the information necessary to plan a route from one station to another – and no more!\n\n\n--- Slide 21 ---\n\nAbstraction\n\n\n--- Slide 22 ---\n\nUsing Abstraction when designing programs\n\nDefining functions is a very good example of how abstraction can be achieved when designing programs\nE.g. the print() function. The programmer knows what it does and how to use it. The program doesn’t need to know the technical details of exactly how the argument you provide the print function ends up on the screen. These details are “abstracted away” by the function\n\n\n--- Slide 23 ---\n\nAbstraction – Leaving Cert Questions (Ordinary)\n\n\n--- Slide 24 ---\n\nAbstraction – Leaving Cert Questions (Ordinary)\n\n\n--- Slide 25 ---\n\nAbstraction – Leaving Cert Questions (Higher)\n\n\n--- Slide 26 ---\n\nAbstraction – Leaving Cert Questions (Higher)\n\n\n--- Slide 27 ---\n\nAlgorithms\n\nAn algorithm is a sequence of steps required to solve a problem\nAbstraction is a key concern when designing a new algorithm. The level of detail required (level of abstraction) depends on the application of the end program. Designing an algorithm for a robot vacuum cleaner to move around a room in a house requires a different level of abstraction to designing an algorithm to ensure that a self-driving car can travel safely on a street\n\n\n--- Slide 28 ---\n\nAlgorithms\n\nAlgorithms for computers must meet the following criteria:\nBe specific and clear. Every detail and every possibility must be accounted for because computers can’t guess or rely on previous experience\nConsist of a finite number of steps. The algorithm must terminate (no infinite loops)\nHave a clear flow of control from beginning to end\n\n\n--- Slide 29 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions (Ordinary)\n\n\n--- Slide 30 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions (Ordinary)\n\n\n--- Slide 31 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions (Ordinary)\n\n\n--- Slide 32 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions (Ordinary)\n\n\n--- Slide 33 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions (Higher)\n\n\n--- Slide 34 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions - Higher\n\n\n--- Slide 35 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions - Higher\n\n\n--- Slide 36 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions - Higher\n\n\n--- Slide 37 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions - Higher\n\n\n--- Slide 38 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions - Higher\n\n\n--- Slide 39 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions - Higher\n\n\n--- Slide 40 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions - Higher\n\n\n--- Slide 41 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions - Higher\n\n\n--- Slide 42 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions\n\n\n--- Slide 43 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions\n\n\n--- Slide 44 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions\n\n\n--- Slide 45 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions\n\n\n--- Slide 46 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions\n\n\n--- Slide 47 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions\n\n\n--- Slide 48 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions\n\n\n--- Slide 49 ---\n\nAlgorithms – Leaving Cert Questions",

Must decide either to keep them or remove them from the data set.\nMissing data can cause problems and have a significant effect on the conclusion drawn from the data. Missing data points can be removed from the data set during pre-processing\n\n\n--- Slide 9 ---\n\nStage 3 – Analysis\n\nEven when data is presented graphically, the finer details are not always obvious.\nAlgorithms can offer greater precision to those interpreting the data\nUsing algorithm to calculate frequency, mean, median, mode, minimum, maximum can add clarity and produce information that is easy to understand.\n\n\n--- Slide 10 ---\n\nStage 4 – Visualisation\n\nOnce the data is pre-processed, it can be presented as meaningful information. This is normally presenting the data visually in a graph or picture.\nVisualisation can be carried out before or after pre-processing and analysis\n\n\n--- Slide 11 ---\n\nAccessing the Data -\n\nIn this part we will look at code to read in, store & retrieve data from files stored on you computer\n\n\n--- Slide 12 ---\n\nAccessing the Data – Python Lists\n\nMost analysis such as frequency, mean, medium, minimum, maximum and mode can only be calculated on data held in a list.\nOnce the data is in a list, it’s possible to perform pre-processing\nmyList=[1, 19, 27, 8, 1, 5, 9]\n\n\n--- Slide 13 ---\n\nAccessing the Data – Text Files\n\nA text file is a type of computer file that only contain plain text.

The text is read from the file as a string\n\n\n--- Slide 17 ---\n\nRead in contents of text file\n\nDifferences from last code\n“r” indicates that the file is to be read\nVariable dataIn used to store all the contents of the file that is read using file.read()\n\n\n--- Slide 18 ---\n\nAccessing the Data – CSV file\n\nText files are useful but are not very suitable for storing numerical data, such as multiple temperature readings\nThere is no standard way to separate each value in a text file so a computer can read each value separately.\nCSV files are used to store numerical data. Commas are used to separate data items.\nFile extension is .csv\n\n\n--- Slide 19 ---\n\nCreate a CSV file\n\nCreate a file in excel and open it\nEnter 5 numbers in adjacent cells in the first row\nSave as a .csv file and open it using notepad, not excel\n\n\n--- Slide 20 ---\n\nAdvantages of CSV files\n\nPython can read and write to them quickly (same as text file)\nExcel has a limit on the number of rows it can have. This may not be big enough for some uses.\nMany applications can open and work with CSV files so you can use the file even if you do not have excel.\n\n\n--- Slide 21 ---\n\nCreating, writing to and reading a CSV file\n\nThe code is identical to the text file except for the filename/extension\n\n\n--- Slide 22 ---\n\nReading a CSV file\n\nThe variable dataIn is of type String. When reading a CSV file, the file.read() function reads in the characters as a single string. Some analysis such as the mean, cant be performed on strings\n\n\n--- Slide 23 ---\n\nReading a CSV file\n\nThe variable dataIn is of type String. When reading a CSV file, the file.read() function reads in the characters as a single string. Some analysis such as the mean, cant be performed on strings\n\n\n--- Slide 24 ---\n\nExtracting CSV file to a list\n\nA list is created from the string using the .split() function.

You can select the password\n\nTask 3\nWrite a python program to ask a user to enter a password. Check whether the entered password is the same as the password in the text file.\n\nTask 4\nWrite a python program to ask the user to enter 10 values using a loop. You can assume the values are numbers. Save these values to a .csv file\nHINT: you will need to add the commas in the program to convert the data to.csv format or you can use the append argument\n\n\n--- Slide 30 ---\n\nPre-processing Data – Removing Data\n\nIf item in list is identified as an outlier or invalid, it can be removed\n\n.remove() function will remove all instances of that specific value in the list.\n\n\n--- Slide 31 ---\n\nPre-processing Data – Removing Data\n\nSometimes removing data is not a good option especially if a list is been used with other lists\n\n\n--- Slide 32 ---\n\nPre-processing Data – Removing Data\n\nWe removed the erroneous data in numbs using the .remove() function\nThe order in numBS has changed by removing the missing values. The number of brother and sister no longer match up with the student names correctly\nThere is also 2 instances of missing data\n\n\n--- Slide 33 ---\n\nPre-processing Data – Imputation\n\nImputation involves replacing missing or erroneous data with alternative values\nOne imputation algorithm finds the average of all the non-missing and non-erroneous values and then replaces each missing value with the average\n\n\n--- Slide 34 ---\n\nPre-processing Data – Imputation\n\nThis is useful because:\nIt keep the list the same size and keeps the location of each item\nThe code for the algorithm is easily modified to impute other values, beside the average, depending on the context\nImputation used for scientific and statistical work where it is not practical for people to check each data point\n\n\n--- Slide 35 ---\n\nImputation-Step 1\n\nImputation involves replacing missing or erroneous data with alternative values. Step 1 - find the average of the non-erroneous data\n\n\n--- Slide 36 ---\n\nImputation-Step 2\n\nStep 2 – Replace all error values with calculated averageNonErroneous\n\n\n--- Slide 37 ---\n\nPractice Time- 10 mins\n\nPage 79  - Task 1\nCreate a python program to remove items from a list using a loop\n\nPage 79  - Task 2\nCreate a list of 20 numeric items, then:\n\t- Sort the file in descending order\n\t- Save it as a .csv file\n\t-Find the largest and the smallest number in the list (without using max or min function)\n\n\n--- Slide 38 ---\n\nDefinition of an algorithm\n\nAn algorithm is a sequence of steps required to solve a problem. An algorithm can be described in different ways:\nWritten as a list of steps in english\nFlowchart, to draw each step and show the flow of control\nPseudocode (a mixture of English of English and and programming language)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwd4piEEyR0 (1.11)\n\n\n--- Slide 39 ---\n\nExample of an algorithm\n\nList of steps in english\n\nFlowchart\n\n\n--- Slide 40 ---\n\nExample of an algorithm\n\nPseudocode – mixture of English and programming language\n\n\n--- Slide 41 ---\n\nFlowchart Symbols\n\n\n--- Slide 42 ---\n\nAlgorithm practice\n\nA sensor to detect lead pollution from a mine has been installed in a local river.\nUse an algorithm\n(i)step by step in english\n(ii) flowchart,\n - to design a program to read in the pollution level, determine if it exceeds the limit, and if it does, send an alert to the local authority.\n\n\n--- Slide 43 ---\n\nStages of Analytics -> Analysis\n\nPython is very popular for analytics because of the speed of writing python code to analyse data.\nimport statistics has functions for minimum, maximum, mean, median, frequency and mode.\n\n\n--- Slide 44 ---\n\nAnalysis - Minimium\n\nmyList=[1, 9, 27, 8, 1, 5, 9]\nMinimium => The smallest value on the list\nSort the list in ascending order: [1, 1, 5, 8, 9, 9, 27]\nExtract the first value from the list => 1\n\n\n--- Slide 45 ---\n\nAnalysis - Maximium\n\nmyList=[1, 9, 27, 8, 1, 5, 9]\nMaximum => The greatest value on the list\nSort the list in ascending order: [1, 1, 5, 8, 9, 9, 27]\nExtract the last value in the list => 27\n\n\n--- Slide 46 ---\n\nFlowchart Symbols\n\n\n--- Slide 47 ---\n\nFlowchart for Minimum & Maximum using sort function\n\n\n--- Slide 48 ---\n\nAnalysis -> Minimum and Maximum\n\n\n--- Slide 49 ---\n\nFlowchart for Minimum without using inbuilt functions\n\n\n--- Slide 50 ---\n\nFlowchart for Maximium without using inbuilt functions\n\n\n--- Slide 51 ---\n\nAnalysis -> Minimum and Maximum\n\n\n--- Slide 52 ---\n\nAnalysis -> Minimum and Maximum\n\n\n--- Slide 53 ---\n\nAnalysis - Mean\n\nmyList=[1, 9, 27, 8, 1, 5, 9]\nMean => The average of the data set\nGet the total => 1+9+27+8+1+5+9 = 60\nDivide by the number of items in dataset => 60 / 7 = 8.57\n\n\n--- Slide 54 ---\n\nFlowchart for Mean without using inbuilt functions\n\n\n--- Slide 55 ---\n\nAnalysis -> Mean Manual Method 1\n\n\n--- Slide 56 ---\n\nAnalysis -> Mean Manual Method 2\n\n\n--- Slide 57 ---\n\nAnalysis -> Mean Manual Method 3\n\n\n--- Slide 58 ---\n\nAnalysis - Median\n\nmyList=[1, 9, 27, 8, 1, 5, 9]\nMedian => The middle number of the dataset\nSort the list in ascending order: [1, 1, 5, 8, 9, 9, 27]\nFind the middle number: [1, 1, 5, 8, 9, 9, 27]\nIf you have an even set of numbers, average the middle two to find the median.

This is used for to create simple graphs/charts.\nmatplotlib.pyplot is assigned the shorter name plt\n\n\n--- Slide 69 ---\n\nStages of Analytics -> Visualisation\n\nIn this example plt.plot takes in 1 list as an argument, myList.\nIt can take in more than one list. e.g  plt.plot(names,numBS)\nThe .plot() uses the values in myList as the y-axis values.\nIn this example, there are no x-axis values, the pyplot interface uses the list index number 0,1,2,3 ….etc as the x values\n\n\n--- Slide 70 ---\n\nStages of Analytics -> Simple Plot with no Labels\n\n\n--- Slide 71 ---\n\nVisualisation – Labelling the graph\n\n\n--- Slide 72 ---\n\nVisualisation – Simple Plot with Labels\n\n\n--- Slide 73 ---\n\nVisualisation – Options\n\nSometime a line is not suitable for what you want to display.\nA line between point suggests the data is linked in some way\nThe following code plots the points without any connecting lines\n\n\n--- Slide 74 ---\n\nVisualisation – Options\n\n\n--- Slide 75 ---\n\nVisualisation – Options\n\nThe line style consists of two or three characters. The first represents the colour and the second/third indicates the point style\n\n\n--- Slide 76 ---\n\nVisualisation – Working with the X and Y axis\n\nIf no x-axis labels are supplied by the coder, pyplot uses the index of the list for the x-axis values. How could we get the students’ names on the graph?\n\n\n--- Slide 77 ---\n\nVisualisation – Working with the X and Y axis\n\nTo get the names of students onto the graph, use another list`. In this example called names\n\n\n--- Slide 78 ---\n\nVisualisation – Working with the X and Y axis\n\nThe first argument in .plot() is the list names. This represents the x-axis labels.\nThe second argument in .plot() is the list numBS. This represents the y-axis values.\n\n\n--- Slide 79 ---\n\nVisualisation – names used as x-axis labels\nnumBS is y-axis values\n\n\n--- Slide 80 ---\n\nTasks Pg 88\n\nTask 1 -> Create a list of 20 numerical values, then:\nCreate a plot\nAdd a y-axis label\nAdd a title\nShow the plot\nSave the plot image\nTask 3 -> Create a python program with 2 lists, one containing the names of 6 students and the other containing the heights of the 6 students in meters.\nCreate a plot with red dots (not the default blue line) with the heights on the y-axis and the names on the x-axis.

For example, the items at list indices control[0], fertil1[0] and fertil2[0] are assumed to all correspond to 7days;  control[1], fertil1[1] and fertil2[1] all correspond to 14 days etc.\n\n\n--- Slide 89 ---\n\nVisualisation – Display 3 data sets on the same graph\n\n\n--- Slide 90 ---\n\nVisualisation comparing 2 or more datasets\n\n\n--- Slide 91 ---\n\nVisualisation – Display 3 data sets on the same graph\n\n\n--- Slide 92 ---\n\nVisualisation comparing 2 or more datasets\n\n\n--- Slide 93 ---\n\nThe Brief:\n\nHypothesising, making predictions, examining evidence, recognising patterns and reaching conclusions are at the heart of Computer Science. In this applied learning task, students will identify an interdisciplinary topic, develop a hypothesis and utilise existing resources to highlight the salient information and inform future decisions. By identifying, analysing, and deconstructing a problem, students will deepen their understanding of core practices and principles of Computer Science.\n\n\n--- Slide 94 ---\n\nTeam Members\n\n\n--- Slide 95 ---\n\nThe Task\n\nFirst identify an interdisciplinary topic where data analytics would be useful. This might mean collecting data for a scientific experiment, looking at population statistics, historical data, vocabulary use in English, surveying your classmates or even analysing social media posts. These are just a few ideas, look across your other subjects and you're likely to have lots of options. Remember you're looking for datasets that you can find the mean, median, mode and frequency of. Idealy It's best to choose something you'd like to gain a better insight into, that's where data analytics is most useful!\n\n\n--- Slide 96 ---\n\nStep 1:\n\nDefine the topic, data source and make a hypothesis.\n\n\nBrainstorm a few ideas for topics with your team before you decide on your topic:\n\n\n--- Slide 97 ---\n\nStep 1:\n\nDefine the topic, find your data source and make a hypothesis.\nFind your data source\n\nhttps://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets\n\nhttps://www.dataquest.io/blog/free-datasets-for-projects/\n\n\n--- Slide 98 ---\n\nStep 1:\n\nDefine the topic, find your data source and make a hypothesis.\nDescribe the data source, where you got it from and where you stored it.\nExample:\nfocusireland.ie. The number of homeless people in Ireland over the course of 3 years from November 2014 - November 2017. Stored in a .csv file in the same folder as the Python Script.\n\n\n--- Slide 99 ---\n\nStep 1:\n\nDefine the topic, find your data source and make a hypothesis.\nMake a hypothesis:\n\nAn Example: The number of people that are homeless in Ireland has been steadily increasing over the past few years from November 2014 - November 2017 Our hypothesis is that homelessness is steadily increasing annually.\n\n\n--- Slide 100 ---\n\nBreak down the problem into sequential steps that need to be achieved to complete this task.\n\nRecommended order:\n-Source, Collect, Clean and Transform Data\n-Algorithms for Processing Data\n-Data Visualisation\n- Data Interpretation\n\n\n--- Slide 101 ---\n\nStep 2:\n\nStep 2:   Source, Collect, Clean and Transform Data\n\nNow that you have selected your topic it's time to gather/collect data. Make sure to save the data somewhere safe so that you have access to it (if it's not that big you can add it as an addition on your webpage\n\nOnce you have your data it might need to be cleaned prior to analysis. What format is it currently stored in, .xlsx, .csv, .txt, does it need conversion? Are there characters/symbols you need to remove? Would the data be best stored in a list  ?\n\n\n--- Slide 102 ---\n\nStep 2:\n\nStep 2:   Source, Collect, Clean and Transform Data\n\nOutline the methods and functions you used to clean and transform your raw data (this can include using desktop applications and/or coding techniques), excel etc.\nExample:\nThe dataset was large. We removed any rows we did not need from the dataset using MS Excel. We then used MS Excel to remove dollar signs and  commas in numerical data.  We read the .csv file and then split it into separate integers (in a list) ready for finding the averages.\n\n\n--- Slide 103 ---\n\nStep 3:\n\nStep 3:   Algorithms for Data Processing\n\nDescribe the algorithms you used and why?\n\nExample:\nWe used the mean and median algorithms in the program as they were the most relevant to the data\n\n\n--- Slide 104 ---\n\nStep 4:\n\nStep 4:   Visualisation\n\nDescribe the graphical output type you chose and why?\nInclude an images of the charts / graphs.\nNow that you have your data processed it's time to visualise it to make it easier to interpret. There are many ways to visualise your data, be sure to choose the options that will make analysing the data easiest.\n\n\n--- Slide 105 ---\n\nStep 4:\n\nStep 4:   Data Interpretation\n\nNow that you have your data processed and visualised it's time to use some human brain power to intepret the findings!\n\nWhat have you learnt from the data, how does it compare with your hypothesis and what future predictions or decisions will it effect?\n\n\n--- Slide 106 ---\n\nStep 4:\n\nStep 4:   Data Interpretation\n\nWhat have you learnt from the data, how does it compare with your hypothesis and what future predictions or decisions will it effect?\n\nExample:\nWe have learned that the levels of theft arrests made in Mountjoy Prison fluctuated between 2003 and 2016, with a peak in 2003 and a low in 2007. This did not fit our hypothesis. Around times of recession, theft rates increased, for example from 2007 to 2013. They also fell during times of economic wellbeing.\n\n\n--- Slide 107 ---\n\nStep 5:\n\nStep 5:   Write your report\n\nYou must include your code, datasets, graphs & plots as part of your html report.\n\nRemember to comment your code to explain what is happening in your code\n\nSUBMIT your report, code, datasets, graphs and plots",
